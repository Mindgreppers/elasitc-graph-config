Since, we are committed to value, human goals can be achieved throgh value based education.;Social awarness camps can be conducted to create people in neighbouring village about harmony in human being and nature. Student Volunteers togther with faculty mentors can inculate natural awarness by planting trees, reducing pollution, water management, cleanliness. Organization can adopt nearby villages and employ the skills and teach values to make that village model for remaining instituitons to follow it.;As discussed during the lecture, the same order follows in my family also. Human values have to be self expolred by us, so it may followed by our children with right understanding and right feeling of relationship. Self verification should be taught to   our children, rather than imposing certain thought upon them which will lead to domination. Self exploration will lead to better generation.;1.Planting trees. 2. Avoid plastics. 3. Save Water. 4. Cleanilness of my surroundings. 5.

Training the teachers through 3 (or) 5 (or) 8 days either online or face to face workshops cannot bring reforms in human being. As a famous saying ""Rome cannot be built in a day"", human valus cannot be taught in an workshop or a day lecture. I suggest AICTE should include Human Values (or) Value Education as a mandatory course for all the 4 years in any Engineering institution. In all the 4 years atleast in odd (or) even semster, weekly (or) atleast 15 days once human values lecture should be there. Also the 4 courses, each one in 4 years has a minimum credit and there should be examination to test how much students self explore themselves by undergoing human value course. Real life projects also can be given to enhance right understanding and right feeling in the students. Finally, I like to suggest AICTE, that teaching human values in the Induction program is not sufficient to bring change in student community.";I will do my best to kindle right understanding and right feeling in students by sparing atleast 10 minutes in a week during my Mathematics lecture to teach human values apart from what is done during induction program. I will put my effort in future and also already counselling students from weaker background and students who perform poor in their studies to understand their values and motivate and try to explore their self confidence. I will remain as the back end for AICTE to fulfill the tremendous efforts to spread human values in the students community.t

Education-Sanskar 2. Health-Self regulation 3. Production-Work 4. Justice-Preservation 5. Exchange-Storage;Justice is recognition of human-human relationship, its fulfilment and evaluation leading to mutual happiness.;Preservation is the recognition of relationship of human being with the rest of nature, its fulfilment and evaluation leading to mutual fulfilment.;The natural process of development of a child in an environment of relationship needs to be understood and fulfilled so that the child grows into a human being who can have the competence to participate in the universal human order.;For all 3 family members: Husband, 2 girls(less than 3 yrs old),  Mother, Brother: Serve and cook meals on time.

If there is a feeling on the basis of sensation, this is the case of infatuation where the sensual pleasure becomes the major goal. Infatuation is conditional ï¿½ it may last only as long as you are able to get the sensation or you have hope of getting happiness through sensation. It is very temporary; it does not last for long. Once the effect wears off, then the long-term issues of feelings become prominent. With this background, we can ask ourselves which can have continuity: ï¿½ Right feeling in myself or ï¿½ Getting right feeling from the other The answer is quite obvious that there can be continuity of right feeling, if it is from within and based on right understanding. But generally, we do keep making effort for getting right feeling from the other in continuity.";The organization goal is 'Value addition through education'. it maps to the 1st dimension of Human order of education leading to right understanding and right feeling.;We conduct various CSR projects with NGOs, Blood donation drives, old clothes and used item donation and tree planting in our compound.;Yes.

Should our students compete? What about collaboration? Doesn't competition create winners and losers? Its hard to know what to believe when it comes to competitions in education because there is so much misinformation and seemingly conflicting research studies on the topic.  We wanted to cut through the confusion and get down to the research-backed impact. In this post we only address a few of the positive benefits that students can receive. We do recognize that there are potential detriments from competitions. We'll address these in a future post and explore how to avoid them. It is also important to understand that not every competition will provide all of these benefits, and not every competition will be structured to maximize benefits. Through the expanding use of ICS's best-practices in competition design, more and more programs are beginning to understand how to structure the rules and processes of the competition to maximize Net Collaborative Impact.  In future posts we'll explore each of the benefits listed below in more detail and review some of the actual research studies that help us understand how they work. For now, we're going to give a brief overview of a few selected personal benefits to the participants. This is not a comprehensive list, nor is it a full examination of the research. It is a selection of benefits pulled from the research literature that we deemed highly potent for our students.;Ensuring the naturally acceptable feeling in oneself and sharing it  with the other ?

";"A key point that underpins the distinction between understanding and belief is that; it is easy to think of instances in which one understandï¿½or at least partly understandï¿½an idea while believing a completely different idea. For example student understands the concept of solar system still believing his/her religious doctrine. So beliefs are the ad-hoc values while correct understanding is the universal human values.";"Every Human Being aspires to be happy. All his efforts are toward this end. The
outcome from his efforts depends on the focus of the effort, specifically on his notions
about happiness. When these notions are right, the outcome is mutual happiness.
When the notions are wrong, the outcome is unhappiness.
The purpose of education is to establish right understanding in the human being so that by a
certain age, the individual is able to gain clarity about happiness and the programs to ensure it.
The process which enables a human being to lead a happy life in continuity regardless of region,
caste, creed, gender, race etc. can be termed as Universal Human Education. Such an education
only can lay the foundation of an undivided society and universal human order, which all of us are
looking for.
Today, with different people having different notions of happiness, one can observe the mixed
result at an overall global level in spite of significant material gains, there is increasing strife in
family and society as well as damage of nature leading to significant and potentially irreversible
climate change.
All this is happening in spite of the best of intentions, so the question this raises is ï¿½Have we really
understood our basic aspirationï¿½?
 Basic Human Aspiration
On closer observation, we can see that every human being aspires for a way of life which ensures
happiness for all human beings living in harmony with nature.
At an individual level, happiness is harmony and integration among all four dimensions within the
self - Thought, Behaviour, Work and Realization.
At the level of society, individuals aspire to ensure harmony and integration among four levels -
Individual, Family, Society and Nature.
This is the aspiration; this is the desire, this is the innate need of every human being, regardless of age, gender, caste, creed, nation and beliefs.";Nature is the fourth level of living;Physical order;Human order; In nature all the three orders other than human order are mutually  fulfilling for themselves as well as for human beings ? Mutual fulfillment is naturally acceptable to the human order ? Due to lack of right understanding, the Human order is not yet able  to ensure mutual fulfillment. This can be seen in the form of  problems such as pollution, resource depletion, extinction of  animals, global warming and threats to human race on earth.;Rationale and Need for the Training Policy.;Yes very much want to participate

It is not within the scope of science and technology to provide the competence of deciding what really is valuable. Value Education is a crucial missing link in the present education system.

As elders we must practice what we preach and our younger generation imbibes from us . Todays youngsters in fact are wiser, they need to validate an issue before accepting it and according to me it is good . only we need to build in them the right understanding so that they can validate based on natural acceptance. We must explain to them the "" why"" of an issue and they will figure out the ""How "" of it. That way they may come up with more innovative and ingenious solutions to issues.";Waste segregation and management at unit ( individual home ) level.;Ensure environmentally friendly practices in common area like canteen etc...don't waste food campaign...recycling of kitchen waste etc. ;Use ecofriendly means of transport . Energy efficient ways of utilities such as lighting etc.;This program has made us reflect upon ourselves in a very objective manner devoid of any preconditioned view etc. However this is like vehicle overhauling, we need to keep doing this at regular intervals to reiterate the learnings. And we must reflect upon and practice in our actions thereby spreading good values to our family, friend, colleagues , students and the society at large. ;UHV workshop is an excellent program, only it may have to be tweaked a little bit to make younger people understand the importance...the earlier they realize , the better for them...they will be at peace with themselves and also in harmony with nature.;For starters, I have spoken about the program and advised my colleagues to take it up. Once teachers undergo this , it is easier for the learnings  to percolate on to the student community and thus a happier youth and happier nation can be built.

Students can take up activities of educating the poor people in terms of basic health and hygiene rules. Cleanliness drives, health checkup camps can be conducted. Regular health related and societal  issues including substance abuse can be discussed with them as many people are not aware of the ill effects of this.  Students should donate voluntarily Rs. 1 per day and this money collected should be used to develop neighbouring area of the college. ;In my family none of us do social drinking or smoking or go to any such parties. My son is fully aware of the ill effects of these and himself agrees that his friends have taken up these habits from their own parent. Most of the youngsters nowadays stay awake till late night while in my family we follow strict daily schedule even on sundays. So my son has imbibed these good habits because of our family sanskar. None of us in family tries to dominate the other in any way, this has lead to peaceful interactions. Neither force my child to follow something but explain him the pros and cons and leave it upon him to decide. ;I will plant trees and maintain a garden. Avoid using vehicle as far as possible to conserve natural resource such as fuel. Also be a vegetarian so as to respect animals and ensure their protection as they also have the faculty of self.  ;Plant more trees in our locality including the campus. Train our students to conserve natural resources. implement the concept of reduce, recycle, regenerate and reuse. Apply principals of green chemistry and avoid animal studies. Chemical use should be minimal and follow appropriate procedure for their disposal.;Maintain cleanliness and plant more trees. Avoid unnecessry use of crackers and vehicles to preserve environment. ;Knowing each of us has the same purpose, potential and program for mutual fulfillment but only difference in competence. So evaluate and empathise with everyone and behave accordingly. Maintianing relationship is more important than getting the work done. Be Assertive rather than arrogant. ;Conduct such workshops regularly but without assignments and not for certificate alone. Reduce the documentation work done by teachers and allow them to have more time for interaction with students in the working hours. Award student groups who take up social activities. ;You can take the help of Education wing of  Brahmakumaris who are excellent in conducting such practicals sessions of meditation which is based on recognizing our innate qualities, to know WHO AM I, To understand the world drama, know the universal supreme father, to know the world cycle and understand the present times of change.  The value education is fruitless without spirituality as human being today has lost his competence and very few individuals actually have that ability to respond.   For empowering the students with right understanding and right feelings, we can create a value based THOUGHT LAB  to relieve the stress in students. NCU is the first university in Northern India to set up a ï¿½Thought Labï¿½ a novel concept for creating pure, positive and creative thoughts in individuals. It is a unique project aimed to harness the hidden and still untapped inner power of extra-ordinary resource i.e. the Mind of an individual. The NorthCap University in Delhi/NCR  offers this new concept for the benefit of its students. This facility is bound to act as catalyst for development of a robust mind to enable students sustain through difficult times. This would lead to a positive attitude for learning, innovative thinking and elevated thinking which is ï¿½forgive and forgetï¿½. We can have students come up with solutions to societal problems and also learn along with practical examples. We should conduct relaxation sessions and self introspection sessions for students. In between two lectures some motivational song can be played or some inspiring stories can shown to students. On personal level I would definitely contribute provided my other workload is reduced as I have also done BA in Value education and spirituality by Brahmakumaris. If AICTE integrates certain spirituality tips offered into this UHV then it will actually attain its goal of creating a happy and prosperous society.

Very importantly, I learnt today is, Units of nature; and out of four levels, where we are, how depended we are and what is our responsibility towards nature. And more than that how we should fulfil for other three units of nature. This session visualized how or what is the responsibility of human beings.";"2.	A discussion about the human goal and human order is what I felt is important. Right understanding, Prosperity, Fearlessness and Co-existence ï¿½starting from individual till nature, what we need to build as natural acceptance.";"3.	In todayï¿½s session I could able to learn many values. Especially, the ï¿½affectionï¿½. Affection is the acceptance of the other as oneï¿½s relative, the other is like me. From the session, it is understood, how affection works-out internally, when we love other or family. As well as, feeling of responsibility towards the ï¿½selfï¿½ and ï¿½bodyï¿½ of our own members in relation with CARE & GUIDANCE.";"4.	The other concept I have learnt today is, REVERENCE. The feeling for acceptance for excellence. Also the discussion about excellence and competition, where excellence is the helping to others to bring them to our level.";"5.	Glory, Gratitude and Self-Reflection are the values, which we can in build as natural acceptance, as within us. And very importantly, ï¿½Loveï¿½ which is complete value in out of nine feelings, where we always misunderstand certain other feelings with Love, which was clarified.";From the session, what I learnt is right understanding, through this value, I'll try to reduce the differences.;The first thought, which is spread-ed inside the campus is, COMPETITION. When competitive mind has been removed from the individuals, and leaning is treated as learning for life, then automatically, excellence slowly will arrive.;Repeated sessions like this and a vast meaning about love need to explained to the teenagers. Usually according to youth, love means, only Girl and Boy. Especially, media too delivers only such messages. SO, to bring changes in the society it is very important to have certain control over media.;A Goal of any institution is giving a healthy, good, excellent products to the society. As a part of the institution even I, work for the same.;Since institutions always on the right path of building education, definitely it is trust-worth to the society or neighborhood. Where there is a trust, definitely, there will be a understanding. ;I have a kids of age eight and five. In them, Imitation and following can be naturally. As they grow up obedience may reduce, which need to shown by me, by remaining obedient to my elders.;Being a former's daughter, today during the session, I thought of planing as much as trees possible.;As an Institution, rain harvesting techniques I used to involved with. And swach bharath mission is another task along with Institution.;Cleanliness is a major concept, need to keep other orders of the nature safe, cyclic and a healthy environment.;After attending these sessions, at my level, the feelings especially trust I want to come up with. For the trust, right understandings of the relations are must. More than imposing on my kids as well as students, I wish to propose the situations. Very importantly, I want become human being rather than animal being by being human with my family, with my neighborhood and in the society.;By making some compulsion value added courses;Being humanity teacher, I wish to put my effort, join my hand along with AICTE.

The feeling is for all, and it is expressed to those who come in contact;Our Natural Acceptance is for living in Harmony  as an Individual, as a Family, as a Society;Justice is the recognition, fulfilment and evaluation of human-human relationship, leading to mutual happiness;The differences between family members can be overlooked by natural acceptance.;Activities like National service schemes, social services etc can help students to attain the natural acceptance;Periodic training on universal human values, social service activities etc can make students understand the true meaning of life;To impart quality education in engineering and technology. The students are supposed to use the skills attained for the betterment of society;"In addition to Engineering and technology, the students have to be given the training on human values and  Nature/Existence for living in accordance with our
Natural Acceptance";"Human beings inherently have a natural acceptance to know,
to be in harmony. For this, human education-sanskar
Is essential. My son was ignorant of how to deal with others with harmony. After initial hip-cups, he now manged to do so with the guidance of teachers and friends. Perhaps, his ability in this direction would have been more, if training in such direction is given due importance in our education system";Meditation and self assessment;Training on Human values;Make our friends involve in social service activities;Meditation is the best cure to for refining, reviewing right understanding and right feeling at my personal level. ;Implement UHV as a core subject in education (if possible from school onwards);I am happy to be part of the efforts by sharing  my little thoughts in the direction.

I can say I will make a program to be helpful to each other in the weak area. With an example, which I always do whenever necessary.My life partner is not so much interested in cooking and she really doesn't like it. So whenever I think she is quite bored and don't want to cook, I cook something new as I love to learn new menu. That's how I am complementary to her. She also helps me in any matter she could be, without asking her to do it. Coming to rest of family members, my mother is helping my wife when it comes to take care of my kids. As my wife is also working, and my wife helps her in every possible ways in her illness or other matters. So, I think that's how we are complementary to each other.;In the competition we can not have both of the world's. The outcome of competition win-loose, and definitely it creates a gap in relationship of the students. As a soft skill teacher, I always encourage students to help each other. So, I will give some kinds of the assignments to the team of the students to help and come out with the solutions with using minimum possible resources. This not only will develop the trust and teamwork, but students will also learn to use proper resources.;As the students are progressing into the classes from first to final year, the bond of friendship, loyalty and compassion also grows. Taking it as an advantage, the meaning of love can be explained in the harmony of their relationship. The competitive relationship will turn to brotherhood and they can understand the meaning of love.;"The goal of our organization is, ""Social transformation through dynamic education"". Social transformation will not be possible without the active involvement of the each human being. Social transformation can begin from one individual and when same human values are accepted by the society, then only we can see transformation. Dynamic education could be possible when I have right understanding, and feelings, fearlessness and co existance of huan being, without havig bias.";Institutions have different goals then the commercial organizations. Institutes are for the betterment of society. So, the competition is not there to earn more profits and money. I think this will be the right understanding the organization can develop. So, this right understanding can be developed and institution when working more on to achieve the goal for which it has been established will be leading ti create a good example for the neighboring institutions.;Yes, I can see it in my family. As a father of 5 years old kid, l understood it very clearly. Children do copy everything we do consciously or unconsciously. It's very common and can observed by each one in the family. As the environment changes, kids follow it. For an example, when I pick up a book and read it, my son also try to imitate the same, he picks up slate or notebook, chalk or pencil, sits beside me do read or write alphabets and numbers, when he is in the company of his uncle he picks up someone's mobile and watches videos and this goes on... ;Right understanding and right feeling;Mutual fulfillment;Relatedness;Right understanding and right feeling is required for every sphere of life  I am leading to. I know it's very easy to say thanto done. At my personal level I will strive to think about right understanding of the other person's problem, feelings and attitude before I will formulate my response to the person even in clashes. This is what, I think, is most important for me. As I know you can not have control over the other people's thinking, reaction and attitude. Definitely I can can not control their action and reaction. But definitely I can control mime. So I will think calmly and will not become slave of my own feelings and do not let them dominate my response.;Many times teachers do not know the solution to the problem or even they can not imagine and find out. The condition of India is very diverse and vivid, so it led to create many problems and issues in teaching learning process. To develop right understanding and right feeling, I urge AICTE to organise such programs as the current one, on the many issues which are in existence. The another factor which creates a block is though such programs are conducted, but many of the faculties and teaching, non teaching staff could not participate in such workshops. SobI think AICTE should broaden the program and activities.;In this effort I will do participate and also wish to train the teachers, students and concerned staff. First of all there should be formal permission from the institute and organisation to do so. Though we are conducting this program for the students the scope and area can be increased. Further AICTE should instruct all the university to prescribe a syllabus, so that college could implement them formally.

Then on that basis we will chalk out the program as per the individual. For Those members who have less competence, we will try to enhance their competence through dialogue and continuous encouragement. We will also try to enhance our capability to make them understand. And for the members whose competence is higher , we may try to make them understand by raising our capabilities or will find a suitable person whose competence is equal to or higher then him.  ;"We will try to make the students that Working for Excellence and competing with each other is not the same thing and are completely different things. In excellence, one helps to bring the other to his level whereas in competition, he hinders the other from reaching to his level. We can share the concept of ubantu to them.  It is often translated as ""I am because we are,"" or ""humanity towards others,"" , but is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean ""the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity. It leads to win win situation for both/all. That can lead to mutual happiness.";"Firstly we will try to make them understand that Love is not that which is being shown in the films, which is one of the major influencer on the minds of the students about love. Then next step will be to share with them common misunderstanding/misconceptions about love. We will clear their misconception of Love by Excitement (from sensation, preconditioning), which is primarily confused for feeling. Then we will share with then that the Sensation Lust, getting from the other is not possible in continuity. It is only Preconditioning or their belief. We have to clear the difference between Infatuation or Love at First Sight. We will try to develop the Right understanding (natural acceptance) for Love in them and make them understand feeling of love is that being related to all, responsible towards all, giving to all. It must also have Continuity in Once trust, respect, affection, care, guidance; Reverence, Glory, Gratitude  and finally LOVE are ensured within, then the feeling of being related to all follows naturally.";Our common goal is to inculcate Right Understanding in the Students to make them a good citizen of our country and overall a sensible human being who can take care of himself, family, society at large and the environment. I hope that matches to the Human goal.;By visiting the economical weaker societies/ sections nearby and students can take assignments/responsibilities of educating and inculcating right understanding about self, family, society and environment.;Yes, I had observed this. One incident I can recall is about my elder son when he was 3 year old. We generally gather with my husband's cousin sister and brother   on rakhi and bhai duj as they are in the same city. After the ceremony of tying rakhis was over, my husband and his cousin brother started touching legs of their sisters and elders present over there as a mark of respect and getting blessings from them. My son who was around 3 years old also started the same without any instruction to him. I can see the imitation, following and also obedience in his act.  ;Planting atleast four saplings in the neighborhood every year and take care of them to become trees ;Also plant sapling in the organization premises and neighborhood. We can also drive awareness camps for the nearby societies and develop right understanding regarding environment.;Also plant sapling in the neighborhood societies. We can also drive awareness camps for the nearby societies and develop right understanding regarding environment.;I think meditating and minutely observing on our thought process. Analysis of our thoughts that where they are negative full of hatred or positive full of compassion and gratitude. Also analyzing whether the thoughts that have arrived are coming from preconditioning, sensation or Right understanding. Whether my actions are governed by my thoughts which came from right understanding or not. If they are from preconditioning or sensation whether I am able to correct my thoughts are being swayed away with it. Whether I am able to control my feelings or not. I think by this process, I will be able to develop right understanding and right feelings.;In every vacation period organizing such Workshop/FDPs for the teachers and the students and can offer some incentives to the Institutions also whose management are able to allow the faculty to attend the Workshop/FDPs and retain the trained faculty as well. As most of the Institutions are facing a bad period with lesser number of students, the teachers should not be punished by making them resign, it will hamper their motivation in upbringing the students and society at large in developing right understanding and right feelings.;Surely, if I am able to inculcate the values within me after verifying the same , I would like to mentor the students in developing right understanding and right feelings.

Sudha;At the level of society, the human goal is right understanding and right feeling (happiness) in every individual, prosperity in every family, fearlessness (trust) in society and co-existence (mutual fulfilment) in nature/existence.;Goal is fulfilled by human order, i.e. systems for education-sanskar, health-self regulation, production-work, justice-preservation and exchange-storage. These systems start with the family order, and are interconnected right up to world family order, leading to universal human order.;The natural process of development of a child in an environment of relationship needs to be understood and fulfilled so that the child grows into a human being who can have the competence to participate in the universal human order.;Nature is the collection of units. It can be classified into four orders, (physical, bio, animal and human). There is a relationship of mutual fulfilment amongst these. It is already going on in the first three orders. Human being also has the natural acceptance for mutual fulfilment. All that we need to do is to understand it and live accordingly.;Existence is co-existence, which is in the form of units submerged in space. Units are energised, they are self-organised and they recognise their relationship with other units and participate with them in a mutually fulfilling manner (except for human beings without right understanding).;Gratitude is significant in the development of relationship;(In excellence, one helps to bring the other to his/her level;Love is the feeling of being related to everyone, to all. It starts from affection, which we have already explored. If this feeling expands to many and ultimately to all, it is the feeling of love. So, we begin with the feeling of affection, and complete it with the feeling of love. That is why, Love is called complete value. Love is the feeling of being related to all. Love is expressed in the form of compassion. The feeling of love is for all and it is expressed to whosoever comes in contact.;Families living together, in a relationship of mutual fulfillment;"The base of harmony in society
is harmony in family for which the base is harmony in human being";Education is essentially to develop the understanding of the harmony or order or vyavastha at all levels of our living ï¿½ from self to the entire existence. Sanskar includes the commitment, preparation and practice of right living. The preparation includes learning the skills and technology for right living. This leads to living in harmony at all levels from self to the entire existence.;There is a need to understand human being as it is (as co-existence of Self and Body). The significant part is having the feeling of self-regulation in the Self. This can happen only when the Self is in harmony, i.e. there is right understanding and right feeling in the Self. With a feeling of self-regulation, the Self will naturally nurture, protect and rightly utilize the Body, resulting in health of the Body.;Ensuring right feelings (trust, respect, affection, care, guidance, reverence, glory, gratitude and love) in myself ï¿½ this leads to my happiness.;The society with happiness in every individual, prosperity in every family, fearlessness (trust) in the society and co-existence (mutual fulfilment) in nature/existence is realized. This is oneï¿½s participation (value) vis-ï¿½-vis society.;Existence is co-existence, and the role of human being is to realise co-existence in the Self and live in co-existence in nature/existence, extending up to universal human order. In this way, the unfolding of the co-existence will be completed through human being ï¿½ resulting into universal order.;Existence is co-existence, and the role of human being is to realise co-existence in the Self and live in co-existence in nature/existence, extending up to universal human order.

So, for me it is even more important to identify and clarify the family values in order to maintain the harmony needed in a family enterprise. Values alignment helps to clarify why the family should remain together as one cohesive unit. ;My programme to promote the effort for excellence in the students would be the following: 1. A focus on the student, on student learning and on personal support for students and their development, rather than on formal teaching. 2. A macro focus on the wider learning environment and the development of the curriculum or programme, rather than a micro focus on teaching. 3 Finally, an emphasis on efforts to develop teaching, especially through innovation, through influencing others and through leadership of teaching. ;An institution can make efforts to help the students understand the true meaning of love in the following manner - 1. Telling the students what they want or need to hear, whether its the truth or not so that it hurts less and/or you can communicate more. 2. Getting those prescriptions and taking someone to their appointments despite it being out of your way (here in case of a student) 3. Compromising to a degree not on core values or your identity but on relatively inconsequential matters or things you eventually find inconsequential because of its detrimental effects on the relationship. ;The common goal the organisation in which I serve is to provide Education to students for life. This has a direct relevance to the human value system. The ultimate goal is not just to create Managers but to create Managers who are humane in nature, who will be brand ambassadors of the their alma mater. ;I and my organisation can contribute to ensure the right understanding and right feeling in the neighbourbood on the basis of living in harmony. That is, to coexistence. I think at the level of individual (here self), the right understanding or resolution can be ensured in every human being as the possiblity of an undivided society or neighbourhood and the holistic natural order and human tradition are the key as one lives according to the right understanding and right feeling. ;Yes education- sanskar in my family is basically a resolution in each member of the family mutually fulfilling relationships and prosperity.;Process of behaviour- in me, human-human rleationship, Naturally accepted feelings in relationship, thought of how to fulfill these feelings and finally expression of feelings in behaviour;Values, Ethics, Morals, Commitment and Leadership;Trust, Respect, Care, Guidance and Reverence;Once we have recognised and fulfill the feelings, this will lead to mutual happiness in relationship. Evaluation is a process when we live in a relationship and we are constantly evaluating ours' and the others' feelings in the relationship. ;AICTE has been developing right understanding and right feeling in the teachers and students through its Universal Human Values programme that is helping the teachers and students in the right development of their world-view, mindset, perspective and values. ;As far as my involvement and commitment is concerned, I will voluntarily take up the above mentioned tasks as and when there is the need to ensure the smooth and efficient running of the curriculum.

For example, my mother in law who is aged cannot do household chores but she can give helping hand in guiding or telling moral stories to my younger daughter who is only 7 years old. Similarly, my elder daughter can help me in small household chores. My husband in fact helps in making the children task done while Iam engaged in my professional and household work.

In that particular time we can explain them about true meaning of love showing some inspiring talks on the topic, reading from books , games etc can be introduced  to give a clear meaning of love to the students. They must be made to  realised that love starts with trust , respect and affection .A volunteering programme such as serving meals to the needy or distributiong some clothes etc can be done. With this they will ensure that love is expressed in the form of kindness, beneficience and compassion. ;"Provide student-centric education and training on cutting-edge technologies to make the students globally competitive and socially responsible citizens.

Training the teachers through 3 (or) 5 (or) 8 days either online or face to face workshops cannot bring reforms in human being. As a famous saying ""Rome cannot be built in a day"", human valus cannot be taught in an workshop or a day lecture. I suggest AICTE should include Human Values (or) Value Education as a mandatory course for all the 4 years in any Engineering institution. In all the 4 years atleast in odd (or) even semster, weekly (or) atleast 15 days once human values lecture should be there. Also the 4 courses, each one in 4 years has a minimum credit and there should be examination to test how much students self explore themselves by undergoing human value course. Real life projects also can be given to enhance right understanding and right feeling in the students. Finally, I like to suggest AICTE, that teaching human values in the Induction program is not sufficient to bring change in student community.";I will do my best to kindle right understanding and right feeling in students by sparing atleast 10 minutes in a week during my Mathematics lecture to teach human values apart from what is done during induction program. I will put my effort in future and also already counselling students from weaker background and students who perform poor in their studies to understand their values and motivate and try to explore their self confidence. I will remain as the back end for AICTE to fulfill the tremendous efforts to spread human values in the students community

My opinion is that, this quality really makes one strong from within.";Care and Guidance are a natural outcome of Affection. Affection comes naturally, if we have a feeling of being related to the other.;To achieve excellence, is to help the other to rise up to a level that is as good as ours.;"Gratitude is a feeling of being thankful to those who have made an effort for me. ""To have gratitude is to count the blessings that we have.""";Love is being  kind, being sensitive to the needs of others, being compassionate. Love is the foundation of undivided society.;When it comes to the family, I feel it's the most important to communicate well with one another. We can keep calling them once in a while to find about their welfare. We can sometimes visit some aged relatives with some fruits and spend an hour or two with them. Once in a while small fellowship meals and get togethers/family picnics can be arranged, so that some of us can get some quality time to spend with each other. As discussed in the session, feeling of love can build the bonds.;When there's a feeling of being one or being together, it would be easier to promote excellence in the students. According to me adolescents by nature are friendlier than us the adults. Some group activities which involve them working together, making them share and discuss with their peers, allotting some activities, where group performance matters and the entire group would get a same grade for the activity, would make them to nurture their peers who are slightly weaker than themselves to give a good presentation. ;Children when very young, know that love is affection that they get from their parents. But usually as they reach the age of adolescence, they begin to get different views due to what they see in movies. We can explain to the students the characteristics of love as nurturing, caring, being affectionate, helping, showing compassion etc. Then we can tell them to speak of some person in their lives, who must've shown these attributes towards them. As students keep discussing, it enables them to think of some family member who has made them feel these. As an extension of this, we can sometimes arrange some visits for the students to some orphanages, old age homes, homes for the destitutes, and tell them to see if they have the capacity to exhibit these qualities to the least of their brethren in the society, OR can they exhibit the same to some one who's not their level in their surroundings. I think this will also help the students learn the true meaning of love from their peers too.;" The basic goal of my organization is to impart education that is academically oriented. Apart from this, there are some sub goals as enabling the students to motivate themselves, help their peers in time of need and make themselves better citizens of tomorrows India. For this, my organization arranges for some motivational talks for the students by inviting some eminent guest speakers who speak and counsel the students. Some security teams who can educate the students on women's safety, where not just the girls are educated, but also the boys, who are taught to help those in distress, irrespective of who they are. Some health talks too are arranged by some renowned doctors and yoga teachers. 
             By listening to such speakers, students try to analyze and discuss of these talks and realize that the ultimate goal of these is the betterment of the society.";As a team, we can organize for some counselling sessions for the society. Some good counselors can be invited and it should be kept open for the society around and also the students and parents. Apart from this, some health camps too can be arranged for others. Students should be made to work as volunteers. This will enable the students too to understand the real meaning of Right understanding and Right feeling for the neighbourhood and teach them some simple ways to live in harmony with the society around.;"There are different types of education. Technical education, Professional education, etc . Education-Sanskara, is that education, which teaches the values of life. Though we are from different backgrounds, there are some values which are acceptable to all with respect. Living in harmony with others is one such Sanskara which is valued. 
Yes, as questioned, I do see such things in my family. As was answered by me in the Q&A session, Children learn by examples. In the early stages of life, they imitate their parents in speech and mannerisms. Our relationship with others makes them realize their relationships with their peers and friends. Some things as respecting and helping  the aged, irrespective of who they are, like the vegetable vendor, dhobi, ayah in school, etc. When our children notice that our speech towards them is polite and respectful, they too learn from us and follow these for the rest of their lives. Sometimes,  instead of celebrating a grand birthday party with friends, when we show our children some under privileged kids, they volunteer to have a quiet dinner with the family and donate some amount to an orphanage. These things when we discuss as a family, children learn to be grateful for all that they have, right from the food that they have on the table, to the clothes in the cupboard, for good health and for healthy body parts that they are born with and thank God for His Blessings.";I can plant trees in my neighbourhood, segregate the garbage in different bins and encourage our society members to do the same, Dispose the waste properly and keep our streets clean, Educate some people on the benefits of health and hygiene & Use our natural resources such as water without wasting it.;Plant trees in the college campus, teach others verbally as well as by example not to waste food, Save water by not allowing water leakage & try to increase the use solar energy and conserve electricity by switching off power, whenever not required.;Keep proper bins in society and segregate the waste properly, Plant trees in the surroundings, Use rain water harvesting to save rain water and let it seep into the ground, keep surroundings clean for everybody's convenience & See to it that water doesn't get wasted for unnecessary purposes.;"At personal level, yes, I too want to live in harmony with Self, Family, Society and Nature. I have always been taught from childhood that ""contentment is great gain"" & "" Too much of Need is Greed"".  I feel happy and satisfied by what I am and all that I have. I want many around me to feel the same. I really appreciate AICTE for this initiative to teach the students. I also appreciate the Resource persons for presenting everything so well in an understandable way. My opinion is that ultimately we all are travellers in this journey of life. None of us are going to occupy this Earth for ever. So, as long as we are here, this is our home and it is necessary for us to live well with all and leave this  World and society as a better place for the next generations, where they'll be able to thanks us for the values that we've transferred from our elders and the society and nature that we've left for them. At a personal level, I want to be a good example to my children and my students too. A good friend and colleague, living in harmony with all and make myself a better human being .";First of all, I'd like to thank AICTE for this initiative. For making the staff realize as to what they are and what they can do for the students. There are different colleges and different universities. All might not give right value to the teaching staff, irrespective of what has been taught. It would be good if AICTE can keep conducting FDPs like this on different topics and give some RECOGNITION to the teaching staff too, so that managements too can give some value to the staff. ;I definitely would like to teach UHV to the students. If it's alright with the University for which I'm affiliated to, I'd also wish to be a part of curriculum development for UHV, prepare myself and train some more people in return and be as a coordinator for this particular course.

Because teachers are not went like this program in their school life also nowadays Family harmony is not up to the level, this imitate wrong self verifications. Why i say 5 years means we should continuously recall and apply the right understanding in our life and student life.if we attend one time program ,i can strongly say it is not enough to bring right understanding. So AICTE can make this UHV program as a mandatory program during summer or winter holidays. Ofcourse i thing it is possible .Degree cannot give such a understanding and evaluation  ,so  i am sure this kind ofFDP help a lot. Secondly students, students are also a imitators of their teachers, if teachers are with write understanding they show their excellence towards students automatically they get right understanding.

Therefore a girl child would prefer help cooking where as an adult father might dish-wash and a mother would prefer administering food serving. the head of the family will take part in financial management where as if the mother has a job, there can be a servant to her work or if during covid period husband will do all the house work etc..;Since I am a computer engineer, think like a compiler - which when the computer program is submitted for compilation, it organises a symbol table, set of variables, allots memory for the variables to compute - decides on what registers to look on what variables. Analogous to this I can decide on which student based on their capabilities to do work. It must be possible to hold a meeting and discuss their willingness to share the work in such a way that job is complete.;Whe I was studying my Engineering, way back in 1985 - NIT, Trichy there were no co-education. We all were in the hostel as the college was residential.  We all respected our teacher so much that intuitively we were blessed with fantastic discipline and my parents were were encouraging. Now the society has changed as I dont remain a student any more. Thus I see that this is a kind of weapon the children use to win us - in case we dont let them go. If the management poses any clever suggestion to get rid of it, then students will misunderstand - and of course - they will not. If we give them lot of home work and ask them to complete and if the higher bodies also encourages such a method the students wont get involved and since they are our students and they will be certainly better than us and that is the order of our natural acceptance.;"""To become a premier Institute of National Repute by providing Quality education, successful graduation, potential employability and advanced research & development through academic excellence."" 
The term excellence brings in reverence - harmony feeling of affection care and guidance - glory gratitude which is significant in the development of relationship in the society.";"1. As an individual, every one of my contrubution will measure as an effort for my Institution's Excellence.
2. The feeling of care, affection, trust in behaving with my Insitution has helped me developing right understanding and right feeling.
3. It has provided me with the necessary physical facility
4. During covid-19 lockdown our Institution distributed free rice and food for the poor people in its neighbourhood.
The above 4 points describe my Institution possesses right understanding and right feeling.";"I used to tell my son that, according to Hindu's myth, there two types of food 1. mithi(food made by your mother) she offers it first to God Prays and serves you which is like amirtham. But if you consume food from a hotel, it is known to be ""nishedham"" - made to attract you to eat again not necessarily healthy. But he will not understand my word and consume it because ""it is only tasty"" - it seems! there are similar circumstances which causes him to deviate from this imitate follow - obedience cycle instead he goes arbitrary - but I am confident that he will get right understanding as he gets more education.";I am a pure vegetarian so I dont let an animal be killed for my food. Use face mask made of washable cotton cloth instead of plastic masks which are hard to re-cycle.;Conserve electricity by avoiding to switch-off gadgets which are not used. Switch off computers when not in need.;Avoid using recyclable wastages. Use mass transport to reduce fuel pollution.;When I am evaluating my students in the subjects I teach, usually some students perform poorer than expected. I will not award them low marks. I will give them more marks but less marks than a fellow who performed better than him/her so that I show a difference. But in the next class, I will emphasize of the topics the weak learner was lacking so that I will give an opportunity for him/her to understand instead of personally address him/her they will have an ego clash.;In my surrounding place, the spoken language is Tamil. Since the language of instruction is English, some students struggle to come up. AICTE can incorporate good e-learning software to let them learn many things online related to their syllabus - free of cost. Students who are academically less competent can be picked and given such training and those who are economically weaker may be given food so that they can maintain their health in learning Engineering in the development of our nation.;I see that the verbatim for the UHV is very much sharable among the technical teachers from the experience I developed in my 5 Day FDP now. If Anna University includes it in their curriculum, it wil become easier. Our college is already an Autonomous institution from the year 2020. Also some of of our departments have already included UHV in their curriculum. SInce UHV is a psychological cource, certainly it will be a foundation for Engineering discipline because computer software itself is highly linguistic and psychological. To avoid brain-drain more planning has to be done.

If these requirements are absent, the child will not be able to grow up as a happy person.;;;;This needs some thought to arrive at!;AICTE should ensure that the college managements do not exploit their staff and students. ;I can help in preparing my own college to hold its own UHV programme and after sufficient experience is gained, I can offer my help to other institutions.

It is important to have relationship of mutual fulfillment between all the orders i.e. each order should enrich the other order. This can be possible if Human beings have right understanding;Remember to love each other in every situation and try to understand that every member is like me.

Conclusion: Noticing and Complimenting the good increases my appreciation for family members and helps them behave better.;Identify the students who are bright enough and call them as teaching assistants. Each teaching assistant will be attached to a group of other students who are presently lagging in respective subject and let them have group discussions and knowledge sharing. Also, it is good to encourage more student clubs where students will be involved in various technical and non-technical discussions on a regular basis.;A possible solution could be to involve senior students in few sessions for interaction with the freshers during the orientation or induction programme. And later, they me involved in some fun activities or sports and games together so as to create good bonding and rapport. This might give scope for understanding each other and thereby develop a feeling of responsibility and a feeling that everybody is like me and they are my family. This probably helps the students to understand the true meaning of love;"Goal of the Organization to which I belong to :- 
To Provide value based education and produce professionally competent and socially sensitive engineers capable of working in multidisciplinary global environment by inculcating in them qualities like team work, leadership, professional ethics, sustainable development, societal responsibility and life long learning. 

Human Goal :-
Continuous Happiness and Prosperity

In my opinion, the goal of the organization definitely maps to the human goal to a major extent if not completely. The goal of the organization clearly gives a sense of direction for the individual to understand himself / herself individually through seminars or subjects and also be able to work with others together in teams which increases their understanding of relationships and mutual fulfillment. Also, the goal is to teach them societal responsibility and also about nature. All this leads to individual as well as mutual happiness and thereby leading to prosperity.";To ensure right understanding and right feeling in the neighborhood of the institution, we can have the students involve in some field trips in the neighborhood areas of the institution and conduct a survey and find out as to how is the quality of living and understand what are the problems (major / minor) persisting in their area (individual or at family level or even at colony or village level). After gathering the problems, start working on identifying the causes of these problems and see how they can be solved. This in my opinion will slowly bring excellence because we as institution are working with neighborhood in order to bring them to a higher level and this also develops mutual happiness and prosperity.  ;"Education is to develop the right understanding of harmony at all levels of our being and Sanskar is the Commitment, preparation and practice of living in harmony. The Process of Education-Sanskar is all about self discipline and it gives an idea of the process of development in an environment of relationships. In my opinion this can surely be seen in my family or any family as well. 

Each person in family has a different level of competence. There are definitely many differences. But it is important to have right understanding within self and about the other self and develop right feelings and have capacity to live in good relationships and also develop right skills prosperity i.e. develop capacity to identify the need of physical facility

For example: Food wastage can be avoided in a family if we can question ourselves even before cooking as to what do i really want to eat to satisfy my hunger and how much do i need. After understanding self, now identify the wants of other self and obviously there will be differences in these wants and quantity. But if we can sit and discuss, we are bound to come up with mutual understanding of common requirement and thereby avoid wastage to maximum extent. If this can be done on a regular basis as a habit it obviously showcases our commitment, preparation and practice of living in harmony.";I would like to plant more trees and crops in our farmland naturally without chemicals. Also earthworms can be allowed to grow in the soil thereby making it good for plant's growth and at the same time we can have a place for Cattle and allow them to feed on the grass available in the farmland itself. ;;;The first and immediate thing I would like to do is learn to meditate and learn yoga and stay fit. And I would like to spend quality time with myself first and have regular interactions with myself. And I would also like to have regular family discussions and appreciate the other's positive aspects on a regular basis. I am confident this helps in strengthening our family relationships. Overall, I would like to see myself committed, prepared and practice this habit of right understanding and mutual fulfillment through relationships;The present program of action on Universal Human Values by AICTE is absolutely excellent. I am confident with this kind of program AICTE will go a long way in the positive direction for developing right understanding and right feeling in the teachers and students of technical education in the Nation. One suggestion I would like to give though is to include Meditation and Yoga sessions as part of this FDP.;AICTE has been doing a wonderful job in this regard and I will be very happy and proud to be part of this effort. I am ready to help in whatever way I can. To start with I have decided to teach this subject for the students and also share the Joy of learning and practicing these universal human values. Also, I am willing to contribute in content development of this subject if given a chance. Thank you AICTE :-)

Care is the feeling of responsibility and commitment for nurturing and protection of the Body of my relative. Guidance is the feeling of responsibility and commitment for development of Self by ensuring the right understanding and right feeling in the Self of my relative. Reverence is the feeling of acceptance for excellence. Glory is the feeling of acceptance for those who have made effort for excellence. Gratitude is the feeling of acceptance for those who have made the effort for my excellence. Love is the feeling of being related to all.; With the clarity of human goals, we can discuss five interconnected, complementary dimensions of human order required for the fulfilment of the human goal. The five basic systems of a human society are:  1. Education-Sanskar  2. Health-Self regulation 3. Production-Work  4. Justice-Preservation  5. Exchange-Storage ; Education is to develop right understanding of the harmony at all levels of being ï¿½ from self to the entire existence (individual, family, society, and nature/existence).  and Sanskar is to develop the basic acceptances of the harmony at various levels.;At the level of society, the human goal is right understanding and right feeling (happiness) in every individual, prosperity in every family, fearlessness (trust) in society and co-existence (mutual fulfilment) in nature/existence. This goal is fulfilled by human order, i.e. systems for education-sanskar, health-self regulation, production-work, justice-preservation and exchange-storage;Nature is the collection of units. It can be classified into four orders, (physical, bio, animal and human). There is a relationship of mutual fulfilment amongst these. It is already going on in the first three orders. Human being also has the natural acceptance for mutual fulfilment.;If the other has more understanding, is more responsible than me, Iï¿½m committed to understand from the other ï¿½ If I have more understanding than the other, Iï¿½m more responsible than the other. I live with responsibility with the other, unconditionally, unperturbed by the behaviour of the other. I am committed to facilitate the understanding in the other, once the other is assured in relationship and not before that.;Project exhibition, Workshop, seminar, conference, social clubs etc.;Love is the feeling of being related to everyone, to all. It starts from affection, which we have already explored. If this feeling expands to many and ultimately to all, it is the feeling of love. So, we begin with the feeling of affection, and complete it with the feeling of love.;To gain the loyalty of the students.

They should learn with true value  and meaning. Education on environmental engineering for disciplines can be included they earn with social and environmental awarness and responsibility. Teachers I am not sure because in private  and government organisations  differ. In private teachers multitask, manage teaching,  research and even clerical work. So difficult to develop ourselves in what we are really interested. Teaching can concentrate more on teaching and pressurizing on research publication every three/six  months will not give quality outcome. Whereas those in research can concentrate more on research, and mostly they are given more comfort with less academic work load.  So work plan for teaching and research should differ.;I would like to initiate faculty development on UHV at our Institute. Since when Faculty realize  the essential of human values, it will eventually be carried to students.

9-25-2020 7:21:57;psgame@pict.edu;psgame@pict.edu;(21-25 Sep 2020) AICTE Incorporating Universal Human Values in Education;Mr.;Pravin Shantaram Game;Love is the topmost and liked the definition: the feeling of related to ALL.;The language of expression of love is kindness, mercy and compassion.;The change has to start from me. I should bring harmony within myself the my family, then society then nature.;To build the confidence in the student, teacher needs to build right relationship with proper understanding and feeling;Whatever we get in education needs to be implemented. Education needs to be converted to sanskar.;First I will rightly evaluate the competence of every member of the family. Identify strengths and weaknesses of every member, including me. Identify the reason for differences. Will try to understand is there any intention to be different from other person. Then is time to bring them together and have a clear talk about the intention, actions and motivation behind the differences and how it is to be resolved. Will convince that their intentions need to be complimentary to each other so that we have harmony in the family.;I am always for a healthy competition. My definition of healthy competition is competition with self to excel and those who are competing with me should have same level of competance. If they lack the competance I should train them to bring it to my level and only then compete. This view of competition makes sure that the one with higher comeptance level is always eager to help others with low competance level. Also, I tell students that every individual is unique. If one is excellent in one area he is lacking on other area. So to have a synergy in the class everyone to try to help others in the area of own excellence. ;Teachers are elders in this scene. It is the duty of teachers to first understand what is true love. First and foremost every teacher should undergo UHV FDP so that he knows the meaning of true love. Just knowing is not sufficient, he needs to accept that true love is affection towards family, society and nature. Girl as well as boy should be taught that love is internal feeling which should help them to harmonise their self with the other with right understanding. Love should not be attriuted on bodily platform. It should not be done just because someone is beautiful/handsome, studious, rich/poor, of some caste/religion etc. This are all external attribiutes. One should see the beauty of the self and should understand that as I have right to think, desire and expect the other self also has right to desire, think and expect. One respect the right feelings of others. If other person rejects ones proposal he should accepts and harmonize within himself and should not get disturbed. If he can harmonize within irrespective of acceptance or rejection of the proposal, one is sure to be affectionate and is then a human being.;Our institution has a goal to create intellectuals with social awareness. The human goal as we are learning in this course is to bring harmony within and then to family and then to society and nature. To bring harmony in the society one needs to harmonize within. So our organization's goal mapped to human goal.;Students are our ambassadors.  Students are the one who are visible around the college. They visit nearby shops for food and stationary. Many students stay in the neighborhood of the college. Corresponding to the goal of the organization we can ensure the proliferation of the right understanding and right feeling in the neighborhood by giving to our students.;Yes. Surely I see the education-sanskar in my family. I see that my daughters imitate their mother. The elder one is now in the follows and obeys her mother. They do have sometime difference of opinion. As they have seen that when their mother has some difficulty she comes to me, the elder daughter request my opinion when she has some difficulty.;1. Do not waste the natural resources. 2. Reuse the natural resources and do not use until they are necessary to be used. 3. Try to use alternative resources 4. Know that the natural fossil resources are limited. Walk to nearby places rather than using the vehicle.5. Plant trees;1. Organizations should reduce the use of papers and make the communication paperless. 2. Resuse the papers. Many times only one side of the paper is used. So there is always a chance to use the other side. 3. Take prints only when they are required. 4. Use alternative sources of energy. I am happy to tell that our institute has put up the solar panels on the terrace of all building and is using solar energy to its fullest. 5. Take efforts to make campus a green campus. A step towards this has been taken by our institute.;1. Should understand that the nature is limited. Though it has mechanism to harmonize itself, the human intervention rather intrusion has terrorised the entire nature. So, first society needs to understand that we are harming nature. 2. In India we have many festivals, we should celebrate them as social events. Like Ganesh festival, instead of having every house a Ganesh, the neighborhood should have a single Ganesh festival. And the idol should be made from the natural elements and not plaster of paris. 3. Society needs to reduce the carbon emissions from the use of vehicle. Every four wheeler should be used to its capacity. People should have trust and respect for others. Car pooling should be used, the state transport machinery should be used. 4. They should plant trees in their surrounding and maintain trees and the green cover. 5. Should reduce the wastage, reuse the water and Should not send used water to the rivers ;I need to better my understanding about the self. I need to see the other person on the level of self and not the body. I need to control my lust for money, name, fame and need to respect others. ;AICTE has already taken the first step towards this by having the FDP on UHV. The syllabus has also been designed and being followed. Now AICTE should see that the teachers are properly trained and they should pass the right understanding and right feeling to the students. The resource persons of the UHV have a very good knowledge on the right understanding and feeling. Once in a week AICTE should call one of these resource persons and have interaction with the  teachers and students of a group of institutes.;I will first make all efforts to harmonize myself and my family. As a teacher I will surely teach students by words as well as personal actions how to develop right understanding. I would surely like to act as a resource person and contribute in teaching the teachers.

It is the emotion of strong affection and personal attachment. In other words, love is a feeling of warm personal attachment or deep affection, as for a parent, child, or friend. It starts with identifying that one is related to the other human being (the feeling of affection) and it slowly expands to the feeling of being related to all human beings.;"Comprehensive human goals are right understanding, prosperity, fearlessness and co-existence.  Programs needed to achieve the comprehensive human goals are:

But in addition to the body, there is also the aliveness of the person ï¿½ the entity that keeps the body ï¿½aliveï¿½ and makes it operate in various ways.;Understanding harmony;Trust;Set aside time for your review. It is no good trying to reflect meaningfully in just five minutes. Make sure you are in no rush, and also that your environment is conducive to quiet reflection.  See our page on Learning Preferences for more about this. Find your original plan, with your goals and planned activities. You need to know what you said you were going to do.  For each planned activity, assess how far what you have done by way of activity was in line with your plan.  You need to be honest with yourself:  How much did you do? Was it as much as you were expecting to achieve? Did you do something different, but more effective? Consider how successful you feel your development has been in getting you to your goals.  Have you made progress towards your goals? Have you identified more activities that will need doing that might slow down your progress? Are your goals (and their timing) still realistic? Decide what you need to do next.  Is it more of the same, or something different? Do you need to take more time, or find some external support, perhaps? Revise your plan to set out your new activities.  It is helpful to document your thinking during the review process. This means you can look back next time and remember why you changed your goals or activities. It also helps to articulate the reasons behind the decisions, and make sure that they are not just ï¿½I couldnï¿½t really be botheredï¿½.     Reviewing Your Goals Every year or so, it is also likely to be helpful to review your personal development goals. As with the review of your planned activity, it is important to set time aside for this process. Again, it is also helpful to document it, because this forces you to articulate your reasoning.  Ask yourself:  Are these goals really what I want to achieve more than anything else? Do they inspire me to take action? If the answer to either of those is ï¿½noï¿½, then you probably have the wrong goals.  Take a look at our page on Setting Personal Goals to see if you can develop new and more inspiring goals.  Changing the picture  If you are struggling to identify your real goals, try doing something different. For example, take yourself away for the weekend and go for a long walk. Walk up a hill and sit and look at the view.  Think about what matters to you. What do you really want out of life?  The advantage of going somewhere outdoors is that the landscape has been there a long time, and it has a way of making things look simpler. But you can try doing almost anything that takes you away from your usual environment and gives you time to think.  It is fine if the answer is ï¿½I donï¿½t really have any goals right now, because Iï¿½m pretty happy with my lifeï¿½. In that case, give yourself a break and donï¿½t worry too much about personal development for a bit. But do come back to it in a few months, a year at most, and make sure that this is still the case.   The answer, however, is more likely to be ï¿½yes, butï¿½ï¿½  In other words, yes, that is still more or less what you want, but you have refined your thinking consciously or unconsciously. In that case, tweak your goal until you are feeling more inspired, and it really is what you want to achieve more than anything else.  Once you have your revised goals, you can then go through the process of deciding what activities you need to develop your skills.  Moving Towards Reflective Practice In time, regular review and reflection on what you have achieved should become a habit. You may find it helpful to read our page on Reflective Practice to understand more about this.  The process outlined on this page of reviewing your plans and goals on a regular basis is a step in that direction. It ensures that you set aside time for reflection, and hopefully, that you start to document your thinking and progress on personal development.  Remember, though, that there is no rush. There is a reason why personal development is sometimes called ï¿½lifelong learningï¿½ï¿½   The Skills You Need Guide to Personal Development Further Reading from Skills You Need  The Skills You Need Guide to Personal Development  Learn how to set yourself effective personal goals and find the motivation you need to achieve them.

With this evaluation, one can work out the program to be complimentary to the other.;Excellence is to be in a state of continuous happiness with the completeness of understanding of harmony and living in harmony at all levels. Once we achieve excellence, it continues. Excellence is something definite, something absolute. There is a basic difference between working for excellence and competition. If you have achieved excellence, you would naturally make effort for helping others to achieve excellence. On the other hand, in competition, we not only do not help rather we hinder the other to reach to our level.;Love is the feeling of being related to everyone, to all. It starts from affection. If this feeling expands to many and ultimately to all, it is the feeling of love. So, we begin with the feeling of affection, and complete it with the feeling of love. While in a class we should call students by their name and not numbers (like serial no, roll no, regd no). By calling their names the student has a feeling that the teacher recognizes me among all and there comes the first sense of affection. When a student makes silly mistakes or intentionally comes late to class, we can scold him/her but we should go back to her in some time and try to reconcile her/him. This way a sense of love and respect can be generated among students.;"Our organization has the following common goal and the mapping with human goals are also shown below.
Educate students to become responsible, enlightened, and productive citizen: - Education Sanskar, Health and Self-regulation
Conduct scholarship and promote entrepreneurship that improve the human condition: - Production-Work
Serve business, education, government, health care systems, and community:- Justice-Preservation
Enhance the cultural environment of the region:- Exchange-Storage";"The fifth  interconnected, complementary dimension of human order viz., Education-Sanskar required for this fulfilment. Education is to develop right understanding of the harmony at all levels of being ï¿½ from self to the entire existence (individual, family, society, and nature/existence).
and Sanskar is to develop the basic acceptances of the harmony at various levels.
Education provides the commitment, preparation and practice of living in harmony at all levels. Preparation includes learning the skills and technology for living in harmony. Our living is an expression of our sanskar.";"A child intrinsically has a desire to understand what is right, to learn right skills and to do what is right This desire to understand is innate in every Self. This is the guidance that is expected by the child. The child wants to know about everything, so asks lots of questions, wants to relate to people around, picks up the language, the accent, the mannerism. The thoughts and actions that lead to contradiction, thus unhappiness, are not satisfying for her/him, and hence the child makes a lot of effort in this direction from a very early age. It expects others to help him/her in learning and in understanding with a feeling of affection. In this process, the child starts with imitating, and then following. In time, progressing to obedience and discipline, all the time assuming the elders to be right. If (s)he is able to find answers and is able to validate them to be right, it leads to self-discipline and self-confidence in the child. The childï¿½s conduct is definite and it is human. On the other hand, if the child finds that the inputs are not right, it starts to have doubts on elders, teachers and hence tries out something on his/her own. If yet the knowing does not take place, the childï¿½s conduct remains indefinite and inhuman. The people around the child then try to restrain the child by more instructions, more domination.
Sometimes, when my two year old cries and asks for something which cannot be given to her, for eg a knife, we normally try to hide that thing. But we should try to make her realise on that place, that it may be dangerous for her.";Right understanding in every human being;Prosperity in every organization;Fearlessness, based on trust and affection, in the society;Concentrating on the self rather than the body;AICE should include a minimum 1 credit subject on UHV and it should be taken online by each and every student associated with AICTE.
