This can be seen on the basis of exploring into the need, fulfilment of need, activity and response of the Self and the Body. In particular, the response of the body is definite while the response of the self depends on assuming. With assuming based on knowing, the conduct of a human being gets indefinite.;The needs of the Self and the Body are of two different types, so they have to be fulfilled separately. A gross misunderstanding is to assume the two to be the same, and this leads to the feeling of deprivation and exploitation.;The activities of desire, thought and expectation are together called imagination. Imagination is continuously going on in the Self. The sources of imagination can be sensation, pre-conditioning or natural acceptance. There is harmony in the Self when the imagination is in line with oneï¿½s natural acceptance. Harmony in the Self is in continuity when all the activities of the Self are awakened.;The Body is an instrument of the Self. Harmony of the Self with the Body is ensured when Self has the feeling of self-regulation and there is health in the Body.;When the Self has a feeling of self-regulation (the responsibility for nurturing, protection and right utilisation of the Body), and it is able to fulfil this responsibility, the Body is in harmony (good health). This feeling of self-regulation is instrumental in identifying the need for physical facility and ensuring prosperity.;15;5;4;6;0,75;25;70;30;i need to aquire money;happiness will go off;harmony will  go off;0,6;0,2;0,2;yes, I would be able to explain the students needs , requirements,  continuty of happiness;Yes;Happy;Yes;;Strongly disagree;Yes;Yes

We always need to have Self-exploration while taking any decisions or during self verification regarding any issue. Self - exploration is always helpful to judge ourselves. Because judging our own behavior is difficult rather than judging others. Self -exploration helps us more to know, criticize, judge and change the behavior.;A discussion or explanation about SELF & BODY, founds me very interesting and acceptable. As well as how, self and body interrelated in the processes like sensation and instruction. Continuing the concept session explored the view on Self-regulation, which really means a lot for every individually, especially to a teacher. When teacher, guide or a parent is able to follow or keep the personality transparent or role model to the students or their own kids, then only they will follow in their lives.;Natural Acceptance is the third concept which motivated a lot from today's session. Natural acceptance directly interrelated with our self or I. Natural Acceptance acts according to our feeling. Hence, keeping or choosing the right is always helpful to keep a good choice in day to day life as well to keep us healthy mentally as well as physically.;Today's session put the vision towards the 'Health' of human beings. This has been explained under the behaviours of SELF & BODY. Physical facility is required to fulfill the responsibility of the self towards the body especially for nurturing, for protection and for right utilization. ;Lastly, one of the important fact I learnt from today's session , i.e. there are trillions of cells are present in individual body, which will be active if our body responds complementarily in harmony. If there is disharmony then it acts negatively, which results negatively to our health. So, keeping one's SELF with positive attitudes, natural acceptance, right understanding will keeps us healthier for a long ;10;3;2;5;80;20;60;40;Physical facility could be a right feeling;right understanding some times stands with physical facility;;30;40;30;Again, I expect to be a teacher or mentor in my profession being a lecturer and being a mother in my family.;No;Happy;No;Unhappy;Strongly agree;Yes;Yes

This can be seen on the basis of exploring into the need, fulfilment of need, activity and response of the Self and the Body. In particular, the response of the body is definite while the response of the self depends on assuming. With assuming based on knowing, the conduct of a human being gets indefinite.;The needs of the Self and the Body are of two different types, so they have to be fulfilled separately. A gross misunderstanding is to assume the two to be the same, and this leads to the feeling of deprivation and exploitation.;The activities of desire, thought and expectation are together called imagination. Imagination is continuously going on in the Self. The sources of imagination can be sensation, pre-conditioning or natural acceptance. There is harmony in the Self when the imagination is in line with oneï¿½s natural acceptance. Harmony in the Self is in continuity when all the activities of the Self are awakened.;The Body is an instrument of the Self. Harmony of the Self with the Body is ensured when Self has the feeling of self-regulation and there is health in the Body.;When the Self has a feeling of self-regulation (the responsibility for nurturing, protection and right utilisation of the Body), and it is able to fulfil this responsibility, the Body is in harmony (good health). This feeling of self-regulation is instrumental in identifying the need for physical facility and ensuring prosperity.;7;2;3;2;72;28;72;28;Lack of right understanding and right feeling;Lack of understanding harmony and living in harmony at all levels;;43;14;43;There is a need to understand human being as it is (as co-existence of Self and Body). The significant part is having the feeling of self-regulation in the Self. This can happen only when the Self is in harmony, i.e. there is right understanding and right feeling in the Self. With a feeling of self-regulation, the Self will naturally nurture, protect and rightly utilize the Body, resulting in health of the Body.;Yes;Happy;No;Unhappy;Strongly disagree;No;Yes

This can be seen on the basis of exploring into the need, fulfilment of need, activity and response of the Self and the Body. In particular, the response of the body is definite while the response of the self depends on assuming. With assuming based on knowing, the conduct of a human being gets indefinite;The needs of the Self and the Body are of two different types, so they have to be fulfilled separately. A gross misunderstanding is to assume the two to be the same, and this leads to the feeling of deprivation and exploitation.;The activities of desire, thought and expectation are together called imagination. Imagination is continuously going on in the Self. The sources of imagination can be sensation, pre-conditioning or natural acceptance. There is harmony in the Self when the imagination is in line with oneï¿½s natural acceptance. Harmony in the Self is in continuity when all the activities of the Self are awakened  ;The Body is an instrument of the Self. Harmony of the Self with the Body is ensured when Self has the feeling of self-regulation and there is health in the Body;When the Self has a feeling of self-regulation (the responsibility for nurturing, protection and right utilisation of the Body), and it is able to fulfil this responsibility, the Body is in harmony (good health).

With a feeling of self-regulation, the Self will naturally nurture, protect and rightly utilize the Body, resulting in health of the Body;Yes;Happy;No;Unhappy;Strongly agree;No;Yes
