The problems are more due to lack of fulfilment in relationship, and we are investing major part of our time and effort for physical facility.;"When a human being has lack of physical facility, (s)he becomes uncomfortable and unhappy. Once (s)he gets the physical facility, (s)he forgets about it and starts thinking about many other things. So, we can conclude that physical facility is necessary for animals; it is necessary for human beings also. However: � For animals, physical facility is necessary as well as adequate. � For human beings, physical facility is necessary, but physical facility alone is not adequate.";"Every time when there is fight, we want to resolve it. We start the next day with the thought that we don�t want to fight today; but a fight takes place again";Human being wants to live with continuous happiness and prosperity and this is possible by ensuring right understanding, fulfilment in relationship and physical facility in the correct priority. This is living with �human consciousness�.;5;4;The basic aspiration of a human being is continuity of happiness and prosperity. To fulfil this, three things are required in order of priority: right understanding, relationship and physical facility, and one cannot be substituted for the other.;Human consciousness is living with continuous happiness and prosperity by ensuring right understanding, fulfilment in relationship and physical facility in the correct priority. Holistic development is the transformation from animal consciousness to human consciousness. Educationsanskar has the most significant role to play in this transformation.;The prime need of value education is to understand human aspirations, to discover what is truly valuable (human value) in life. Value of any entity is its participation in the larger order of which it is a part. The value of human being is its participation towards mutual fulfillment (harmony) starting from within themselves, then extending in their family, in the society and in nature.;The state or situation, in which I live, if there is disharmony / contradiction in it, it is not Naturally Acceptable to me to be in that state / situation;To be forced to be in a state / situation which is not Naturally Acceptable is Unhappiness;�To be forced to be in a state of Disharmony / Contradiction is Unhappiness;Something hard to understand or accomplish or deal with;Lack of skills;Same (neither increasing nor decreasing);distraction ;It is human nature to notice and focus on small, easy to solve problems but much harder to work on the big problems that may be causing some of the smaller ones.;research ;Lack of skills;Same (neither increasing nor decreasing);problems in understanding ;As a problem solver, you need to be able to identify the cause of the issue and understand it fully.

Though, almost 50% and above people are getting education, still the Values are morals in human beings are reducing day by day resulting with inhuman behaviors showcased by present young generations. So, along with education, what we being teachers or parents can guide or train them is ""SANSKAR"", which may lead them a better human being and we expect a better society in fulture. So, from today's session initially, I understood, the perspective of individual about the world-view. As well as, conduct of Human Beings are based on their education. Especially, the 'Sanskar' given to them. ";Human values can be taught at any level. Of course teaching them at primary level is much beneficiary. UHV cell experimented this with different colleges from last 40years, and now this training is planned to give 10000 trainees per month. Hence along with Technical education UHV- 1 (during Induction Programme) and UHV-II (during semester) should be indulged along with syllabus with three credits. For this syllabus, text books, vedios, lessons every think has been created and uploaded in AICTE website. More over that to bring interest in students, regarding the subject we can plan for project on UHV. ;A very important lesson today I learnt from this session, is that the inter-relationship between physical facility, right understanding and relationship. Also today's session was much focused on the perspective of individuals priority out three aspects. What thought I had in my mind was physical facility ( where I was thinking especially the food) might be the first priority. But today's session showed the detailed view, what happens when physical facility becomes the first priority. And, how it affects to the relationships and understanding. So it is better to be right understanding will be our first choice and then good relationships. And physical facility should our third choice, then we can be in a happy environment. ;"One of the important think, I learnt today how animals prefer physical facility. And how we are differentiated from them by choosing it the last priority. As well as when animals get sufficient physical needs, they are comfortable. But if it comes for human beings, we will not be happy for just physical needs. May be this difference makes us to think about, ""where we are?"" And this specific question could be continued by asking to our inner-sense, that, "" where we suppose to reach?"" Because, after having physical facility still we are unhappy and deprived in nature, which we need to reduce it slowly.";We always think of skills. But from the session it was mentioned that, problems are largely due to the lack of human values not because of the lack of skills. ;1;2;writing my thoughts and views. Since writing is my hobby, I search my happiness in that. ;Good relationship with my family keeps me feel happy and I find happy environment surrounded to me.;My achievement in my career. ;Misunderstanding with relationships;Continuous failures after a struggle;Unhealthy condition;Reduced Human Values, culture and conduct;Lack of values;Increasing;1.Decrease moral education, social medias and life style;"1.

Then it will really make an imagineless difference. Thank you.

The content of value education has to be universal, rational, natural, verifiable and leading to harmony. The process of value education has to be a process of self-exploration, rather than being prescriptive. Be it policy makers or decision makers, if I don't have the holistic approach towards the education then I won't be able to make any contribution in the education sector.;Than You for organizing the wonderful webinar. Just one suggestion, if you can share the time schedule for the groups in advance that will be of great help. Thank you once again for all the organizing team.

Sudha;The prime need of value education is to understand human aspirations, to discover what is truly valuable (human value) in life. Value of any entity is its participation in the larger order of which it is a part. The value of human being is its participation towards mutual fulfillment (harmony) starting from within themselves, then extending in their family, in the society and in nature. The content of value education has to be universal, rational, natural, verifiable and leading to harmony. The process of value education has to be a process of self-exploration, rather than being prescriptive.;The basic aspiration of a human being is continuity of happiness and prosperity. To fulfil this, three things are required in order of priority: right understanding, relationship and physical facility, and one cannot be substituted for the other.;Human consciousness is living with continuous happiness and prosperity by ensuring right understanding, fulfilment in relationship and physical facility in the correct priority. Holistic  development is the transformation from animal consciousness to human consciousness. Education- sanskar has the most significant role to play in this transformation.;Self-exploration is a process of seeing the reality on our own right, by our own investigation, observation and analysis. It is a process of dialogue between �what I am� and �what is naturally acceptable to me�. It includes verifying the proposals on the basis of natural acceptance (which is not the same as acceptance) and validating experientially in living.;Happiness is to be in a state of harmony. The expanse of our living is at four levels (individual human being, family, society and nature/existence), and thus the program for continuity of happiness is to be in harmony at all these levels. Prosperity is the feeling of having more than required physical facility.;5;3;Having the right understanding within  i.e., Understanding of the harmony at all levels of being;Through right feeling in relationship, based on right understanding;Transformation to Human Consciousness;Consumption of physical facility;Enjoyment of favorable sensations ;Receiving favorable feelings from others;rising problems of depression;Lack of values;Increasing;incorrect understanding;Right notion about happiness and prosperity and their continuity;conflict between older and younger generations;Lack of values;Increasing;incorrect understanding;Right notion about happiness and prosperity and their continuity;global warming;Lack of values;Increasing;incorrect understanding;Right notion about happiness and prosperity and their continuity;Yes; Indication of Lack of Effort for Holistic Development;Yes;Basic effort is required to ensure human consciousness through human education;3;3;Parents, Teachers, Role models in society;Teachers;Higher education;Faculty development, Sharing values with students, Sharing values with family members, Sharing values with colleagues, Sharing values with neighbors;Having the process of education and right living leads to right understanding in the individual;Excellent

Survival of the fittest which suits well to the animal kingdom, cannot be applicable to humans with better understanding/feelings/being sensitive.;5;5;my Family. Spending time with children and talking to them of their day to day activities, praying together and going out together as family time.;my friends  and my colleagues from all ages and all walks of my life. Sharing some personal and professional information and discussing with others gives comfort and relief.;my home, and my work. Thanking God for a comfortable place to live in, which many might not be fortunate enough to have and also Work which many might be struggling to get. Being grateful and counting our day to day blessings gives continuous happiness. ;Some unfulfilled desires, which could have been fulfilled if some decisions of life were taken at the right time.(not exactly unhappiness, but regret);Sometimes, not getting value for the work done with sincerity and patience.;Unable to do something for others, because it's not within my capacity or reach. In a way, if our near and dear ones are sad for some genuine reason, it makes us to unhappy.;Violence (sexual & physical abuse) against Children and Women.;Lack of values;Increasing;Human Consciousness is going back to Animal Consciousness. There's no feeling for the pain of someone weaker than themselves. Some humans have become mentally unstable or were not brought up in a way that will make them sensitive to others.;Solution doesn't lie in punishing the criminal after the crime is committed, but teaching values of love and respect for others feelings right from their childhood. A strong family with good values will make better children. Educated adolescents and adults should be made aware to be sensitive, not just to their own family and friends, but also to the society and surroundings around them and be ready to help someone in distress. Society consciousness should be developed.;Increase in Divorce rates.;Lack of values;Increasing;Couples are unable to adjust with one another. Initial feelings of love turn to hatred, sometimes due to societal and even family pressures. People are unable to see good in others and family values are getting lost. ;"Today's workshop, reminded me of a verse from the Book of Proverbs from the Holy Bible. ""Through Wisdom a house is built and through Understanding it is established"". So, for a family to stay together, Wisdom and Understanding is required. Books give us knowledge. But wisdom comes from elders in the family. Children should be made to spend time with grandparents and elders at least during holidays, which will make them understand the family values and teach them adjustment and sharing with siblings, cousins and other relatives. Children born into nuclear families in metropolitan cities, studying in corporate schools fail to develop these values and become more of robot kids than human kids.";Unemployment ;Lack of skills;Same (neither increasing nor decreasing);Education that students get in schools and colleges fail  to develop the skills required for any particular profession. Our system, doesn't give value to some professions, due to which a technical graduate might not be willing to take up such professions. For ex - Farming;With an increase in thousands of technical colleges around the country, there's also an increase in the unemployed tech graduates. One reason can be that, most of the students who pass out, are either looking for some govt. jobs or some MNC to employ them. Students don't get an exposure as to how their skills can be developed and how they can use their technical education to develop their surroundings by starting their own ventures or use technology in their already existing businesses, which will not just make them innovative, but also provide employment to others. Sometimes unemployment can be the root cause of people giving more priority to material benefits rather than to human values.;Yes;Lack of family and societal values. Parents, not being able to spend time with their children, supplement it through gadgets for comfort, where a child becomes self sufficient in all ways, not wanting to share and thus ignore the society around and this gets carried to his adult life. His/Her value for some material goods and some professions becomes more than others enabling him/her to become insensitive to what is not theirs.;Yes;Though I ticked yes, there cannot be one solution to any problem. Solutions may vary, based on different classes and societies. Development of skills and values, both are important. Only values do not feed an empty belly. Neither does only skill make a better human being. Skill should be developed by making a student conscious of the society around. Interaction with both the genders, giving equal respect to both and thus enabling them to work in teams and develop their team spirit and mutual understanding, thus making them conscious of the society around  can solve the problems to a great extent.;3;5;"Parents, Teachers, Role models in society, 	Media, Online games . Games that children play nowadays as PUBG involves shooting, killing murder etc. Adolescents gain pleasure and thrill from these. Such kind should be monitored and banned and some substitutes can be developed.";Role models of society;Families (at home);Sharing values with students, Sharing values with family members, Sharing values with colleagues, Sharing values with neighbors, Sharing values in the community, society;As a teacher, I communicate with my students on a day to day basis. Teachers sometimes take up the role of counselors too. On a day to day interaction I can discuss with them, question them of their opinions, listen to them with patience and share mine own views, to make them better citizens by understanding their peers in college and others in society as well.;thank you so much for wonderful session
