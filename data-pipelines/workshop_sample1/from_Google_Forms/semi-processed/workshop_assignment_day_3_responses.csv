When we are complementary to each other there is no conflict of feelings, there is continuity in happiness and prosperity. When the relationship is mutual there is no differentiation based on body, physical facility and beliefs. All respect each other which leads to happiness and hence we live in harmony.;The Performance management system of employees  (teachers) in institution based on the criteria of number of research publications having higher weightage and not on the basis of administrative tasks done by the teachers to help department fulfill its needs in various aspects. From my understanding, it will not affect my performance based on monetary benefits attached to it as i know my purpose, program and potential. I also know my competence. Hence it is right evaluation;A student who was involved in drug abuse and confessed about it and was seeking help. He has reached greater heights in his life accomplishing his passion for the field of interest and has a feeling of gratitude and respect towards me. On the other hand, I am happy for understanding him, guiding him throughh right path and to see him reaching his goals in life after such incident which changed his perspective about living life. Hence it is right evaluation.;A student who wanted to run away from the institution for not being able to cope up in studies and had fear of failure and lacked self confidence. Being empathetic towards such students and showing care and affection will do wonders as it happed in his/her case. he/she could complete engineering and mend relationships with her family by fulfilling their dreams and her responsibility towards them and treats us as her parents. we are complemenatry to each other and she is confident of achieving her goals in life. Hence it s right evaluation;A student who was not happy with the branch of engineering due to the influences he/she had from ehom she called friends and was upset over not getting change of branch. Just by proposing a new friend from the same branch to share the experience brought in lit of changes in the way of thinking and now  he/she is happy with the learning from the branch that he/she belongs to. The problem was  the bad influence. The minute  the student was introduced to the person having similar view he/she could assess that the intention of her parents was not wrong and he/she also had the competence to achievehis/ her goals. Hence, making a proposal to self assess made wonders in the way of thinking. Hence, right evaluation;A son / daughter in law not treating the parents / in-laws rightly and not showing affection and care towards them. However, the parent / in-laws never express grief / sorrow towards the son / daughter in-law and treat them equal and with respect and show affection, love and care. The parent / in-laws are rightly evaluating understanding the competence of son / daughter in-law is lacking and are trying to improve that with responsibility. Henc, right evaluation;Age - as the parents grow older, the tendency of the current generation is to send them to old age homes  / to bring them to metropolitan cities which they are not willing to go to or come to  live in;as per the right understanding the parents must be treated well and they need love care and affection as they grow older, it is our responsibility to understand their need and opinion and make the decision collectively. In case f asking them to move away from the placewhere they have spent most of their life, it is not correct to force / compell them to leave the place and move to cities to stay with family. It is their wish to choose from what they feel gives them happiness and prosperity;Decision making for a policy in most of the organisations  follow top-down approach;Based on right understanding it is true that there is a need for certain hierarchy for having responsibility and accountability in an organisation. But, it is also true that the top management most of the times don't communicate and ask for the opinion from the bottom level management. This builds the conflict in the policy due to one way communication flow. All have to treat each other similar and hence the policy makers should also consider the inputs from the bottom level management. thus the information and communication flow should be two way and not one way.;sects - when we believe all have competence and the purpose, program and potential is same for all of us, the reservation system based on the caste / religion should not exist;When we believe all are similar , having reservation for seats of minority or specific category candidates by having lower percentile score / passing mark for minimum eligibility criteria in competitive exams or to fill the government posts and higher percentile score / passing mark for general category candidates and no reservation for government post is differentiation. The learning ability and attempting questions in examination and facing an interview for a certain job doesn't depend on a particular sector in the soceity. These policies differentiate and lead to disharmony.;key takeaway is competence vary form one self to other self. If i am more competent I take the responsibility to facilitate understanding the other. If the other is more competent than me then i am committed to understand the other. But it is to know that the intention of every self is not wrong but we vary / differ due to varying levels of competence. we should try working on improving one's competence to achieve continuity in happiness and prosperity of my self and other self and vice-versa

But today, the same committee members admire her and praise her and they are proud of her ;"Initially it was not naturally acceptable but after our interaction with her and complying with all necessary facilities, we noticed that the student is blessed with energy of mind, 100% commitment, very studious.

Identify the genuine self and complement each other to create a harmony""";Physical Facility : Post : A Junior Clerk in our Institute who is epileptic and we gave her very routine job of inward and outward entry thinking that it will be difficult for her to perform any other office task.

But then during one of our Performance review meetings we exchanged our thoughts and gave her a chance to explain what she wants to do. In the conversation she requested us to give her class co-ordination activity. Today, she has turned out to be an excellent and reliable co-ordinator giving us 100% class attendance, flawless lecture scheduling, timely payments to visiting faculty and total class control;She clarified her intent and desire to contribute to the Institute building.We believed on her competence and created a complementary happy workplace relationship;Beliefs - Sects- Concession to be given to Muslim students for Namaz in between the lecture  ;An open discussion, mutual respect to their feelings as well as their studious nature was considered.

It is just I will not get angry but give my optimum and in return i am assured that i will get the optimum.;I should make the students understand their self reflection, I should make them understand the different areas of differentiation will only lead to disharmony and disrespect. the reality lies in right understanding of self. Natural acceptance of self is the key to reality and happiness. Because the right reactions comes with only right understanding. trying to accept the other as being similar or just one as you having same program, same potential and same purpose as yours will actually make the right evaluation on the basis of self. And this will surely help us to reduce wrong assumptions and areas of disharmony and help us to lead a more happier and content , self confident and full of competence life for ourselves. Also the right evaluation should be made making the understanding of Under Evaluation, Over Evaluation and Otherwise Evaluation because the right Evaluation is on the basis of self.

Personally, I do the same and i am able to bring about a difference in other people's life. So my intention and competence are on the positive end. When it comes to others, my family members also do the same and how much they succeed in this varies from person to person;Two months back, there was a time when i had to take a decision. The decision had to be taken such that it would be appealing to my parents as well as me. I am a person who becomes happy by making others happy. So I chose a decision that would make them happy and gradually on seeing the smile on their faces I too became happy.;A couple of weeks back there was an incident where i had to shout at my brother for doing something wrong. At that moment, i was completely angry but later when i calmed down I realised that i should have taken the problem in a nice way. Both of our happiness were affected;Then there was this incident where a person whom I trusted a lot, broke my trust. Initially I had complete trust over that person. So I believe u cannot trust everyone blindly nor will that trust be ensured in continuity.;;;There is differentiation among people based on age. When there's a family get together, there may be people from different age group. Sometimes a person would be there who does not belong to any of the age group and may get left out.;Instead of forming small small groups try to bring along everyone together so that it would bring more happiness;There is differentiation among people based on the position. People one step higher in position may not treat the person lower in position equally nor give them the respect they should be given. This includes too much of commanding and given them extreme work pressure;Treat every people at the workplace equally without differentiating them based on their position;There is differentiation among people based on religious beliefs. Sometimes one person may try to dominate over the other based on this. But in true sense, Everything is the same, everyone is equal;Treat everyone with the same respect irrespective of caste, religion etc. Afterall there is only one god;Share the importance of all the feelings of love, care, respect, trust to the younger generation so that they may turn out to be better people and can handle situations better in life

Sudha;"Relationship already exists � we don�t have to create it; rather we only have to recognise and fulfil it. The family is the basic unit of human-human interaction. The basic issue in family is that of relationship. In relationship, there are nine feelings (values) that can be clearly understood and lived with. There is harmony in the family, mutual happiness in the family, when we understand the feelings and ensure in our living.";Trust is to be assured that the other has a natural acceptance (intention) to make me happy and prosperous. Trust on intention is the foundation of relationship. It is the beginning of mutual development. A common mistake is to evaluate oneself on the basis of one�s intention (and conclude that I am good) and the other on the basis of their lack of competence (thus doubt their intention and conclude that the other is bad).;"Respect is right evaluation at the level of the Self. The complete content of respect is to see that the other is similar to me in terms of purpose, programme and potential; and we are complementary to each other in terms of competence. Over evaluation, under/otherwise evaluation and discrimination are disrespect.";"The other feelings in relationship include affection, care, guidance, reverence, glory, gratitude and love. Love is the feeling of acceptance of all; it is the complete value. Justice is ensuring these feelings in oneself and expressing them to the other, leading to mutual happiness. Justice begins from family and extends to the world family, leading to undivided society.";;Father/ Mother;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;No;No;No;No;Father/ Mother;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;No;No;No;No;Teacher;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Not Sure;No;No;No;"Trust or vishwas is the foundational value in relationship. �To be assured that each human being inherently wants oneself and the other to be happy and prosperous� is known as trust. Mutual trust is a shared belief that we can depend on each other to achieve a common purpose. Trust is the expectation of people that they can rely on our word. It is built through integrity and consistency in relationships. There are two aspects in trust:\s1.      Intention (wanting to � our natural acceptance)\s2.      Competence (being able to do)\sBoth intention and competence are the aspects of trust. Intention is what one aspires for (our natural acceptance) and competence is the ability to fulfil the aspiration. In intention every human being wants to do what is right, only the competence may be lacking which needs to be developed through proper understanding and practice. But what we are doing today is that when we are judging ourself we are judging on the basis of our intention, whereas, when we are judging the other we are judging him on the basis of his competence.\sWe trust our own intention while we are not ready to trust the others intention. It is the same for other as well. We find that while we look at our intention, we are sure of it, we are not sure of the other�s intention. We are actually seeing their competence, and making a conclusion on their intention. Hence, mistrust is born and we deny the relationship. We seldom look at our competence and other�s intention.\sIt is very important to differentiate between intention and competence. If we have trust on intention, we have a feeling of being related to the other and we start helping the other to improve his competence, if he does not have enough.";over-evaluation;under-evaluation;under-evaluation;;;First set of differentiation is on the basis of body� on the basis of age, gender, race and physical strength. This is based on the gross misunderstanding that human being = Body. The truth is that human being = co-existence of the Self and the Body.;All these problems can be solved by realizing that the other is like me as he has the same natural acceptance, potential and program to ensure a happy and prosperous life for him and for others though he may have different body, physical facilities or beliefs.;The second set of differentiation is made on the basis of physical facility � on the basis of wealth and post. The gross misunderstanding here is that physical facility = happiness. The truth is that happiness is to be in a state of harmony.;Right evaluation ;The third basis of differentiation is on the basis of beliefs � on the basis of different isms (thought systems like socialism, capitalism, etc.), different sects, and different sets of information prevalent in  Universal Human Values Handout 3 of 5 Understanding Harmony in the Family  7 the society. This is founded on the misunderstanding that if the pre-conditioning of the other matches with mine, then the other is respectable, otherwise not. The truth is that pre-conditioning and right understanding are two different things.;Right understanding;"My participation (value) vis-�-vis my family is to ensure harmony in the family, ensure mutual happiness, ensure justice in the family by way of:\sEnsuring right feelings (trust, respect, affection, care, guidance, reverence, glory, gratitude and love) in myself � this leads to my happiness. \sExpressing (sharing) these feelings with the other. When the other is able to make the right evaluation of these feelings, it leads to his/her happiness, thus leading to mutual happiness. My participation is to be of help to the other in their self-evolution, self-development.\sWith this preparation in the family, I have the ability to participate meaningfully in the larger society � in the neighbourhood, in the community and so on."

The family is the basic unit of human-human interaction. The basic issue in family is that of relationship. In relationship, there are nine feelings (values) that can be clearly understood and lived with. There is harmony in the family, mutual happiness in the family, when we understand the feelings and ensure in our living";Trust is to be assured that the other has a natural acceptance (intention) to make me happy and prosperous. Trust on intention is the foundation of relationship. It is the beginning of mutual development. A common mistake is to evaluate oneself on the basis of one�s intention (and conclude that I am good) and the other on the basis of their lack of competence (thus doubt their intention and conclude that the other is bad);"Respect is right evaluation at the level of the Self. The complete content of respect is to see that the other is similar to me in terms of purpose, programme and potential; and we are complementary to each other in terms of competence. Over evaluation, under/otherwise evaluation and discrimination are disrespect";"The other feelings in relationship include affection, care, guidance, reverence, glory, gratitude and love.

Mutual trust is a shared belief that we can depend on each other to achieve a common purpose. Trust is the expectation of people that they can rely on our word. It is built through integrity and consistency in relationships. There are two aspects in trust:\s1.      Intention (wanting to � our natural acceptance)\s2.      Competence (being able to do)\sBoth intention and competence are the aspects of trust. Intention is what one aspires for (our natural acceptance) and competence is the ability to fulfil the aspiration. In intention every human being wants to do what is right, only the competence may be lacking which needs to be developed through proper understanding and practice.

Rather than imposing on him/her we can discuss it out with the child.;Physical facility - wealth - We normally treat rich people in a better manner than we deal with the poor.;How much money one has does not establish the better value system the person has.

So everyone should be treated equally.;believes -  Sects - In the current scenareo there is general hatred towards the other religion is getting reflected a lot in social media which is misguiding the youth.;No religion is ever good or bad. It our own faith and believe. Based on the bad deed of few poeple the entire relogion should not be blamed. Every religion has many good practices that all can follow. So we should respect each others believe and try to learn good values from others.;"Being an educator, I ll practice and show my students to treat every individual equally as a human being; not to disrespect someone based on his work or money or caste.

At the same time i believe it is important to be able to differentiate between the intention(wanting to) and the competence(the ability to do so). The intention of the other is always to make us happy, just  we always have the intention of wanting the happiness of the other. But, our's as well as the other competence is lacking for which we have to accept responsibility to improve and work towards the right understanding for this improvement. This, according to me in all our relationships the trust is the foundation.;In the recent time an experience of mine made me to rethink about my personal assessment/evaluation of a student in my college. I was extremely impressed by this student of mine during my first few interactions post the formal induction programme. This led to over-evaluate him based upon his exceptional articulation skill. However, to my utter surprise, I found him wanting in major areas such as academics, self-discipline and commitment. ;My experience of under-evaluation stems from the fact that this incidence occurred a few months ago involving a cousin of mine who was an MBA from a reputed b-school in the country. I always underrated her in terms of her knowledge and skill-sets. But, today I feel proud that she is working as an Investment Banker with JP Morgan USA. Truly, I feel very proud of her achievements. This was a huge learning experience for me that is to never underestimate anybody be it your relative or a close associate. ;I had the good fortune of having been associated with this wonderful lady who was a consultant dealing with student campus placements and training in a reputed international executive search firm. My first perception about her was that she is a thorough professional with the right business acumen and an extremely beautiful soul. This proved to be true and today we share a wonderful professional as well as personal relationship. My assessment or right=evaluation was accurate in this case. ;As far as the other-evaluation is concerned, I felt that this student of mine to be an absolute 'hollow' in terms of his knowledge and skills. However, he always came across as an obedient scholar with adequate blend of etiquette and manners. My assessment was proven to be correct as in spite of all the best efforts by all the teachers, he couldn't surpass his own expectations. ;This is a classic example of over-evaluation about a close friend of mine who always had the potential to do wonders and live up to the expectations of others. I was very confident about my friend's abilities and strongly believed that she would do something or be labelled as an achiever someday. To my disbelief, she is happily married with a mother of 3 kids. There was a time, she was aspiring to be an IAS officer who was brilliant in academics. My assessment in this case was proved to be completely wrong. ;Teacher responding to the needs of students (differentiation involves the way the teacher responds to the needs of the studets);It can be influence by belief systems, which are sets of attitudes that are also sometimes called as mindsets. Effective differentiation can only happen by knowing the students academic strengths and perspectives.;Differentiation based on physical facilities is the feeling of having or making available more than it is required. This is ;We can minimize the differentiation as mentioned by limiting ourselves to the need for physical facilities;Age differentiation. ;It is basically acting your age. Different roles and behaviours are considered appropriate depending on whether we are a toddler, teenager or an adult, etc.; I see myself donning the role of a 'Change Agent' wherein I can influence, involve and evolve as an individual by bringing about the change I wish to see in the others and the self. I would consider myself to be very fortunate to be in a profession that is considered to be 'noble'. I believe that with my rich and varied experience I would be able to carve a niche for myself in the three important tenets of our education system - education, training and research.

Here , if another friend appreciate the first person for his job and criticize the 2nd person for not having a MNC job, then it is a differentiation under the category physical facility.  ;The third person should have right understanding that, happiness is not with the wealth , which we got from job, happiness is come from harmony .if the 1st person is happy with the MNC job and the second person is happy with the simple job at his village , where he can stay with his family.

The family is the basic unit of human-human interaction. The basic issue in family is that of relationship. In relationship, there are nine feelings (values) that can be clearly understood and lived with. There is harmony in the family, mutual happiness in the family, when we understand the feelings and ensure in our living.";Trust is to be assured that the other has a natural acceptance (intention) to make me happy and prosperous. Trust on intention is the foundation of relationship. It is the beginning of mutual development. A common mistake is to evaluate oneself on the basis of one�s intention (and conclude that I am good) and the other on the basis of their lack of competence (thus doubt their intention and conclude that the other is bad).;"Respect is right evaluation at the level of the Self. The complete content of respect is to see that the other is similar to me in terms of purpose, programme and potential; and we are complementary to each other in terms of competence. Over evaluation, under/otherwise evaluation and discrimination are disrespect.";"The other feelings in relationship include affection, care, guidance, reverence, glory, gratitude and love. Love is the feeling of acceptance of all; it is the complete value. Justice is ensuring these feelings in oneself and expressing them to the other, leading to mutual happiness. Justice begins from family and extends to the world family, leading to undivided society.";"The feeling of love is not something which is based on sensation. If there is a feeling on the basis of sensation, this is the case of infatuation where the sensual pleasure becomes the major goal. Infatuation is conditional � it may last only as long as you are able to get the sensation or you have hope of getting happiness through sensation. It is very temporary; it does not last for long. Once the effect wears off, then the long-term issues of feelings become prominent.";Spouse;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Son / Daughter;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Father/ Mother;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;Yes;My intention is correct. iam spoiling the relationss lack of competence;About myself- I lost 10 lakhs in stock market because over evaluation of my competence.;Small tussle  due to loss in farming with father because I under  evaluated him ;small fight with my friend in program because he himself over evaluated;;;Disrespecting my son with scolding  and beating him whenver he does mistakesince h;i have to understand that my is of tender age it is normal;Quarreling father  in certain issues; I have understand his back ground and think in his perspective;Under estimate my wifes family memeber for everything;seeing humanbeings in them ;every on wants to be happy, i Have to understand the feelings and background  of students and encourage them to excel in studies to the  best of my ability

Sometimes just being in their presence gives satisfaction. It's the same for them too. Most of the time, my visiting them, or preparing a small meal or buying a small gift, gives them happiness and satisfaction. They are happy that they are being cared for in their old age.\sChildren and myself too, mutually are able to give happiness to each other. Caring for them, spending time with them, sometimes playing and chatting with them gives them and me happiness. It's just the feeling of being there for one another is enough. Children too understand any know the value of what it is to be grateful to both their parents and grandparents for all that they have.\sFor spouse, there are slight variations. Sometimes, just being there and caring for one another is not enough. Both cannot make each other always happy with contentment. There's still some loop holes, as sometimes the larger families too are involved, whether it's for decision making or satisfying the others who are related. This can influence a slight change in behavior and dissatisfaction towards one another.";My daughter got 90 + % in her CBSE class 10 results. Though I'm very happy, my parents had greater expectations. They wanted to see her photo in newspaper as a topper. But I as a mother had to explain to them that what she achieved is very good and there are many who must not have got even that much.;When a new lab assistant was appointed, she was under-evalued by some staff members, as she was very young and not that good in English speaking. But with in a period of two months, the girl proved herself to be very smart in handling the work allotted to her.;Similar to above, some staff members whom we usually over evaluate due to their degrees, proved to be not that good when need arises, without any basic knowledge of computers and the ability to take online classes during covid crisis.;Sometimes, we under-evaluate some students, looking at their physical appearance, quality of clothes or position of parents (auto driver's son/watchman's son) etc. But as time passes by, we notice that those students have grater will power and come up with flying colours.;During our early stages of marriage, we usually over - evaluate our spouses as someone who can make us happy always. But as 1-2 months progress, we observe that he/she is not a super human and is bound by traditions, extended families and customs and we realise that we actually over - evalued them.;Differentiation based on Body. For Ex- when it comes to the complexion / colour of the skin, usually Fair is considered beautiful. Other qualities both physical and non physical don't matter. Very young children too are taught by their mothers that using so n so cream would make them look fairer than their friends. This usually effects the feelings of the dark complexioned kids.;We need to educate our children to see humans as humans first. It's also important to educate the parents not to teach children to make comparisons with the others, based on their complexion. We need to also make people aware that differentiating based on complexion is punishable in some countries and being different from each other is variety. Here comes understanding the values. ;Differentiation based on physical facilities. Usually, it is seen that wealthy and those in high position, do not interact with one another. There's a feeling of not being able to identify themselves with the others.;"t is difficult to change some at a later stage, but here again, knowing human values  and understanding is required. My solution would be to make children of different strata of society  live and communicate with each other. My observation is that there are many elite schools, where usually children from rich families go. These children do not know how to mingle with others in the society, other than their own peer groups. When it comes to this, my deep appreciation goes to some KVS schools. Here children of Group 1 officers as well as those of  Group 4 employees, study together in a same class right from childhood (For example, a class one Defense officer's child and a Jawan's child OR  a Principal's child and Ayah's/Pune's child). This develops the bonding between those kids. They try to understand each other and their requirements. They share food right from their childhood, and even as they grow up to be teenagers, this bonding and understanding grows stronger. Later when they get into the outer world too, they know how to get along with all irrespective of their physical facilities.................. \sPlease make a note, that here I'm not endorsing any brand, but I've given this example after studying my own children.";Differentiation based on Beliefs. According to me, this is a major differentiation to overcome. This was not just present in ancient community, but is present in Today's society too. Wars between nations, cultures and sects is due to this. These beliefs are causing a major disharmony in today's society too.;Main and only solution would be to educate the people to value one another's culture and traditions. Workshop that is being conducted for us now, i.e., Universal Human Value Education should be conducted for all on a regular basis. People should be explained and made to understand that it's not wrong to follow some sect or so, but that ideology should not cause any disturbance in the society. A peaceful discussion of each others values can be done and what is good can be shared. Radical mentality should be brought under control.;As a teacher, I would definitely like to interact with my students, discuss with them of the various differences in the society. Teach them to value and understand their own selves first and then get into harmony with the family and society. Family is an institution made by God for those who believe in him. It is important to nurture our relationship with parents and siblings. I would also like to tell them that society reciprocates to how we behave with it. I believe in encouraging my students to become better human beings first and the certificate that they get would follow them.

The family is the basic unit of human-human interaction. The basic issue in family is that of relationship. In relationship, there are nine feelings (values) that can be clearly understood and lived with. There is harmony in the family, mutual happiness in the family, when we understand the feelings and ensure in our living.";Trust is to be assured that the other has a natural acceptance (intention) to make me happy and prosperous. Trust on intention is the foundation of relationship. It is the beginning of mutual development. A common mistake is to evaluate oneself on the basis of one�s intention (and conclude that I am good) and the other on the basis of their lack of competence (thus doubt their intention and conclude that the other is bad).;"Respect is right evaluation at the level of the Self.

This is based on the gross misunderstanding that human being = Body. The truth is that human being = co-existence of the Self and the Body.;"Complete Content of Respect � We are Complementary to Each Other\sAt the level of the Self, only the competence could be different. Competence means how much of the potential of the Self has been realized. One Self may have realized more of its potential, while another may have realized less of its potential.\sThis difference in competence is to be complementary to each other (not to discriminate and exploit each other).\sThe complete content of respect is to be able to see that �the other is similar to me and we are complementary�.";The second set of differentiation is made on the basis of physical facility � on the basis of wealth and post.

The truth is that happiness is to be in a state of harmony.;"If the other has more understanding, is more responsible than me, I�m committed to understand from the other\s� If I have more understanding than the other, I�m more responsible than the other. I live with responsibility with the other, unconditionally, unperturbed by the behaviour of the other. I am committed to facilitate the understanding in the other, once the other is assured in relationship and not before that";The third basis of differentiation is on the basis of beliefs � on the basis of different isms (thought systems like socialism, capitalism, etc.), different sects, and different sets of information prevalent inthe society. This is founded on the misunderstanding that if the pre-conditioning of the other matches with mine, then the other is respectable, otherwise not. The truth is that pre-conditioning and right understanding are two different things.;With the complete understanding of respect, we can see for every individual on the earth that we all are the same in terms of intention, program and potential. The only difference may lie in the level of competence. I may be having higher level of competence in relation to one, but may be having lower level of competence in relation to another. With this evaluation, one can work out the program to be complimentary to the other.;To get understand and make happy to all do not angry

The complete content of respect is to be able to see that the other is similar to me and we are complementary.;Disrespect arises out of Over - evaluation, under evaluation, otherwise evaluation and differentiation leading to discrimination on the basis of body, physical facility or belief.

Some differences arises in competence. Each of us lack in competence in making others happy. This difference in competence is to be complementary to each other, then only we are able to see that the other is similar to me and hence their will be harmony in the family. To my daughter, since i have more understanding than her, Iam more responsible than her, therefore I should live with responsibility, unconditionally and perturbed by her behaviour. To my spouse, Iam committed to understand from him.;Before lockdown, In my class in college , it so happens that I scolded one of my student for being irregular in class and challenged him if he can score above 20 marks in Mid exam, however he scored 24 out of 25 in the same exam. I felt it was not rightly evaluated but I under evaluated him.;When my daughter comes home late from park after reminding her to be on time, I shouted saying that she has no value of time, indiscipline and will not be able to achieve in life. While the other day before, I was overwhelmed  and praised her for achieving silver medal in the english Olympiad exam. This means that it was not a right evaluation, I otherwise evaluated her.;Since the past six months, Iam staying indoors due to COVID. In the beginning, it was hard to think how it will be for children's education, my job, recreation etc. However Iam experiencing all the necessities of education, recreation or basic needs staying at home although in a different manner. So this is my under evaluation of the present scenario.ying ;An incident was I had to submit a question paper to HoD  for Mid exam as Iam the subject incharge, but that particular day, I could not reached college due to fever. So I asked one of my colleague if he could submit without fail which was lying in my staffroom cupboard. He assured me. But later on, I came to know from my another colleague that he did not bothered to do so and the other colleague have only submitted it to HoD. So, I think I have over evaluated him based on his response.  incharge;My husband was surprised to hear when my daughter in Class II talk about elements in Periodic table at her age. I have experienced that nowadays kids are able to learn things which we did not think at her age can do so. This kind of evaluation is not right and we have otherwise evaluated her.;Differentiation on Body ( Gender) : My mother in law shows more love and affection to my co sister's son than my two daughter's which I really felt is not fair. n;Since I cannot imposed her to change her thought of differentiating, I can facilitate understanding in her and live with responsibility, unconditionally and not perturbed by her behaviour.;Differentiation on Physical facility (Post): Behaving rudely and boastfully to people working in low grade post. lower grade  ;There may be things which such lower grade working people can do than the people working in grade I. Therefore, there must be a feeling of complementariness on one another that the other is similar to me.;Differentiation on Beliefs (sects): Engineer's respecting only Engineer's.;Such imagination that comes from preconditioning should be guided by natural acceptance in which  we have the feeling of complementariness.;As an educator, I have a role to facilitate understanding in the other , live with responsibility and unconditionally to avoid disrespect. I should have right evaluation on self on the basis of natural happiness to make myself and others happy. I must see that the other self is similar to me to avoid differentiation among colleagues and students.

Fortunately, in my relations there is no place for doubt. I do trust other from the familty (daughter, wife and father) and they do trust me in return. That keeps me happy. However, the actions are not always producing happiness. The behavior and actions are sometimes displeasing. Speaking about the intentions based on the recent incidences I am sure that they never meant to hurt me or make me unhappy however the circumstances and situations were such that they were harsh with me. This now I understand is because of lesser competance to deal with the situation. Because of competance we could not handle the situation leading to friction. But it soon deteriorated for that issue but then other issue cropped up.\sThis will continue but now I can understand that our intentions are never to make other person unhappy. Rather it is because of less competance there was disharmony. I will make efforts to improve my competance as well as help others to improve their's.   ";Daughter breaking a glass platform while trying to get the sweets.- Her intentions was not to break glass. But she was told by her mother to brush teeth and then she will get sweets. But she was in hurry and because she could not reach the sweet she tried to take help of the glass and in the process it broke. I did not say anything to her as she was quite scared.

Just because someone has Indian body or American body, I should not differentiate the human being. Both are human beings and are spiritual sparks. In that sense we both are same- Self. Both have capability of thinking, feeling and willing. So externally we are different but internally we are same. ;Two billionair brothers fighting for share in the father's wealth. ;Both thought that I should more and better. They were not thinking about the other person. They did not understand that money cannot give happiness but brotherhood can. They fought a bitter battle and their relationships soared. They could have solved the issue amicably without hurting other. They should have given preference to the happiness in the brotherhood rather than in money.;In India people differentiate based on religion causing disrespect and disharmony;We should not differentiate based on the religion. We need to understand we are children of same God. Our sentiments may be different which should be respected but we all are human beings and in that sense same. Like it is the nature of sugar to be sweet, we should understand that as human being our nature is to love and be loved. We all have desires, we all have capability to think and we all have expectations from oneself as well as others. The right actions under the right understanding will help us. Considering this we should not disrespect other based on religion.;"somehow or other children are being tought to differentiate and discreminate. They see this discremination in house, in family, in school, in society. As they grow they see it more vividly in the nation. Students are the wealth of the nation. It is imperative that they should be taught to see the similarity and oneness on a different level than the visible level. However differentiation is natural. We need to accept it. Male is different than female. On bodily level we are different in looks, on facility level we have different facilities and our sentiments are different. Understadning that though we have different bodies, physical facilities and beliefs  , we are one -- we are human beings, we are similar in terms of desire to be happy.\sSo, in education system I would like ot take role of an educator teaching about the oneness in differences.

In today's session, understanding harmony in family level, has taken up. Where I found trust is the fundamental stone in any relationship. I agreed with resource person and the reflection shown by her. In any relationship, there are feelings which are definite. And trust is the basic fundamental feeling, upon which age of any relationship could be decided.";"2.	In any relationship, the mistake usually will happens are approaches towards us and approaches towards other on any incident. This makes the major difference in relationship. Today's session high-lightened about this point. The necessity of changing the view about others.";"3.	The other point which enlightened me a lot is, whatever might be the situation, how we realize about ourselves, in the same way, we need to see others in that particular situation. Understanding the other person's competence will help to respond the situation in a positive way. Today's session helped to visualize any situation with our perspective or our intention, then only trust will remain in the relationship, by keeping the relationship safe.";"4.	In today's session I understood clearly the necessity of correctly evaluating the person. And what might happen to that person, if we over evaluate, under evaluate or differently evaluate. Any mistake in evaluation may lead to depression or death.";"5.	Understanding harmony in family is the basic need for any individual for present life style.

As it is an abstract concept so until and unless I am not happy about myself, I won't be able to make the other happy. The most important foundational value for any relationship be it spouse, children, parents, colleagues is TRUST. If we are not able to earn the trust of them then we cannot be happy. Until and unless I myself don't ensure right feelings (trust, respect, affection, care, guidance, reverence, glory, gratitude and love) in myself then I won't be happy. But if I rightfully express my feelings then I will be able to participate meaningfully in the global family.;As we were doing the NAAC work in the institute, so I was working quiet late as a result it does hamper my relationship with my family members. I overreacted. I should have understood that they also needed my time and should have been more understanding.;My friend got divorced recently. I tried to explain to her the importance of family but her challenges were greater than I thought. I under-evaluated.;My son and daughter were quiet annoyed in the corona times, as they have to sit at home and study. I had asked them to join activity classes online and it was the right decision, they are quiet happy. I had the right evaluation.;;;We see differentiation everywhere, in our society after corona certain helpers was not allowed to enter on the basis of their caste.;Still to find, as the people have rigid mindset and to change them is quiet difficult.;In institutions also we see differentiation on the basis of gender.;Workshop, Seminars are helpful but the best way is to open the channel of the communication with the seniors.;;;"Looking into the nine feelings discussed in todays session, I would like to have a healthy and justiciable relationship with my colleagues, family, parents and students. As it is rightly been discussed in the session that love is the feeling of acceptance of all; it is the complete value. Justice is ensuring these feelings in oneself and expressing them to the other, leading to mutual happiness. Justice begins from family and extends to the world family, leading to undivided society. i definitely would like to inculcate these values to our budding lawyers."
