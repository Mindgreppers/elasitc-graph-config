Such as due to lack of physical facilities what will be happens in our life and how do we deal with the lack of physical facilities also cross check weather it is must or just for respect point of view we are going to full fill our physical facilities.
Then fulfillment in relationships, Indeed this workshop changes our direction of thoughts and how to look at our relationships and how to achieve fulfillment in relationship without disturbing the harmony of ourselves and others.";Before this workshop, basically my happiness is mostly related to the physical facilities, fulfillment in relationship means when I bought something for me or my family member that time i feel great happiness but I failed to keep that happiness for very long because, when you bought something such as mobile then after few days new version of mobile will be launched and it motivates us to buy again if we by then we feel happiness if not then fill unhappiness, this is happens with us because we don't know for what we are doing everything in life, unless or until we will not realized the difference between self and body we never understand true meaning of happiness.;"Original human nature is to keep himself always happy means happiness is unconditional when you don't have any expectation from anyone.
But it is true for you not for everyone others may be expect more from your ability to fulfill and that time they feel unhappy.
By real understanding we keep ourselves happy otherwise there is always reason for unhappiness.";Purpose education is to achieve the marks first of all and then find the good job that's why most of the peoples prefer the good institutes for their kids.;"According to Swami vivekananda that education is the manifestation of perfection within us and of course this workshop leads us towards the true purpose of education.
Education gives us the real understanding skills, right respect, how to evaluate ourselves and others along with how to maintain harmony.
Main purpose of education is to teach us the differentiation about animal and human consciousness.
How to deal with the failures in life.";"I thought Excellence means to achieve more marks in exam, earn more money through job, in job achieve good position and competition means to compete with others in order to overcome them like overtook the other vehicle while driving.
Excellence is perfection and nobody matches this level of your excellence.";Living in integrity means that everything we say and everything we do are true reflections of what we value, what�s important to us. Think about what your behavior says about you. Does it clearly show others what you value? Do you show up as honest and committed, or dishonest and indifferent? Are you spending your time with the people and activities you value, or is your focus elsewhere?;Trust is confidence in the honesty or integrity of a person or thing. An example of trust is the belief that someone is being truthful.;"To be assured
to have the clarity that the other wants to make me happy & prosperous.
Trust is the base of all relationships, absence of trust creates barriers in relationships whatever relationship is there, Father son, Husband wife, Teacher student, between two friends etc.
We trust on a bus  driver that's why we sit in a bus and enjoy journey without looking towards the traffic.
We trust on a doctor that's why we allow him to do our surgery.";I am always conscious about respect weather he/she give me respect or not, I have always fear of under evaluation by others all thing happens with me because of my overthinking.;"Respect is nothing but right evaluation of -on the basis of self
Our purpose should be same on the basis of natural acceptance in short consider everyone like us.
While you think about yourself then apply same for other persons.
Try to evaluate on the basis of body, physical facility and beliefs.";Gratitude means quality of being thankful and readiness to show appreciation.;"Gratitude is nothing but a part of relationship
It  is  the  feeling  for  all  those  who  have  helped  me,  in  any  way,  in  my  own  effort  to  achieve excellence. In our life, there may be so many people who have been of help to us in the process of understanding  harmony  and  living  in  harmony.  So,  we  have  this  feeling  of  gratitude  for  them. Particularly  in  the  family,  we  can  see  such  people.  We  can see  that  the  parents  and  others  have affectionately brought us up, provided us with necessary physical facility to nurture and protect our body";Prosperity is nothing but to have a luxurious lifestyle where we have a enough money to buy good house, nice car means we never fill lacking of physical facilities.;"Prosperity is nothing but I got a direction to live my life. There is more harmony in relationships in family and at work place. The real meaning of prosperity is now clear as I am satisfied of what I am having today.
At lest I am not worried I am living on a rent and my friend bought a 2 bhk house.";"My definition of ""myself"" which I have compiled before workshop 
There is a small difference between the human and animal is that human have a thinking ability, and this thinking ability is not only based in order to achieve food, shelter like a other animals, there is something different which leads us the new era of technology today.";"To further develop the harmony in nature (at least not to disturb the harmony in nature)
To make right utilization of the physical facility (after all it comes from the rest of nature)
To evolve a way of living in harmony with nature";Family is the group of close relations like Husband wife then kids who live together and live life. first kids are depends on parents then parents will depends on kinds at their older age.;As a human being, we live as an individual human being, as a member of the family (human-human  relationship), as  a  part  of the  society  (social  systems) and as  an  unit  of nature/existence.So, that   is   the   list of   realities   to   be   understood.;Society is nothing but group of large families which follows the same culture.;Society We saw that the family is the basic unit or building block of human organisation and the society is the next larger order Society is composed of many families living together making collective effort for a common goal;Nature is nothing but how someone reacts.;Nature is a collection of four orders, Physical, pranik, animal and human order and mutual fulfillment between the orders.;14;"I am interested to prepare myself as a SIP mentor because
I am very eager to implement what I learned from these sessions for my students.
While I will be prepare me as a mentor then I can understand it more deeply because if you don't know more about anything you can't express it better way.
It seems like a challenge to implement the value based education for this generation because each entity today unhappy due to lack of PFs nobody knows the real meaning of happiness and I think this is an opportunity for me to become a mentor.

Also must  hear their thoughts and act accordingly.;Respect means right evaluation (with a feeling of trust on intention).Respect on the basis of Self reveals that the other is like me and we are complementary to each other. ;Gratitude is to thank the people who has helped me in some means either for my education (or) living (or) lending money etc.;Gratitude is the feeling for those who have made effort for my excellence.;Prospertity is to being in very good position (or) possessing more wealth or having more money.;The feeling of having / producing more than required Physical Facility is referred to as prosperity.;Myself mostly refers to my physical structure and working hard for fulfillment of my physical needs.;My self and the body are co-existence of each other.

These feelings can be recognized by right understanding of self and they are definite.Their fulfilment, evaluation leads to mutual happiness.;Society is a larger group of families living together with their own culture, beliefs and thoughts among a group of families. Society is divided community of people.;"Society is composed of many families living together making collective

It should not be like other subjects taught once and after the exam, they forgot about it. UHV should be taught in a continuos manner to explore a drastic change in the society. They can allot one hour in a week (or) 15 days one hour to teach this subject in all the years, even in final year. Small projects can be given as self exploration to involve students in a better way.

9-25-2020 19:02:40;sandip21aug@gmail.com;sandip21aug@gmail.com;(21-25 Sep 2020) AICTE Incorporating Universal Human Values in Education;Prof.;Sandip Patil;4;5;Right understanding of self and others. harmony with self, family, society and nature, physical facility-what is it and how much is required for human being, natural acceptanace, various feelings in relationships, Animal consciousness, human consciousness, mutual understanding, and much more;I thought that happiness is based on the material things (physical facilities) and when I will possess them then I will be happy. As we grown up thats what we see around the society. We used to see people have big houses, cars and expensive items. So we also tend to think and drive our energy to achieve them. That is what i thought about happiness before the workshop.;After the workshop my paradigm shifted to self harmony and self realisation. That is what matters most for the happiness. This is simply we have attention on all the things which we don't possess. So I shifted my thinking to right understand and right feelings for the self and others.;To educate humans in skills and knowledge by which they can servive in the competative world. Education also enables learner to urn bread and money to live their life peacefully and without financial troubles. ;Eduaction is not only limited to train someone to earn money, it also means a kind of sanskar to be done on the pupils. Students should know what is right understanding and feeling. They have to utilise this understanding and feelings to develop and harmony with family, society and the nature. As these students will be guiding power to the nation tomorrow, they should know what is wrong and what is right.;Excellenece and competion are the two sides of the coin and the coin is life. Without having excellence in oneself, he can not win the competions. To win over other competitors you should exclel in everything you do, To an become eception, you should be far better thasn the others.;Excellence is not when you defeat someone in knowledge or in any other activities. Excellence means completeness of right uderstanding that other human beings or complementary to each other. On competion, one is at higher level than the other who lose. So, it creates win-loose relationship, which may create a gap in human beings and will not be existance of equality. So, excellence means one helps to bring the other to his level.;Trust is very important in human interaction. Trust takes time to develop and can easily broken. I used to take time to trust someone as friend. I do not trust everyone around me, as people are always ready to use us for their perosnal gain. So, thats why I trusted very few colleagues and friends around me.;The meaning of trust has completely changed after the workshop. Trust does not mean that other people outside are there to loot you. But it means that you shoild be assured that other people around you are there to make happy and prosperous. Again this is a paradigm shift for me to understand the meaning of trust.;"My thoughts on respect were one sided only. I was just expectiong that my family, friends, society; everyone I dealt with should give me proper respect. The respect is given based on what we did to the people. I may disrespect someone, but no ne should disrespect me.";As the foundation of my thougts on respect feeling were onesided and wrong, I learned to understand that respect is between the onself and the other self. Both the people are on equal level when it comes to give and get respect. Respect means right evaluation of self an the others.;Gratitude is a kind of thankfulness arises in us when someone has helped us into our problems. Gratitude can be temporary, as I also thought that everyone needs help and support and some or other person is always there to support and help.;"But gratitude has more broader meaning than what I thought before attending the workshop. I can see that the other has a feeling of care, affection, trust in me and in my interaction with him or her. Gratitude also means ensuring the right feelings in
yourself and expressing them to the other.";I thought about prosperity as gaining more wealth and success at the professional level. It was very limited and only limited to my scope and importance. Prosperity for me was considered as progress made at every level of my life. So prosperity somehow was a selfish concept for me.;Through the workshop I got a new meaning of prosperity, which was exactly opposite what I thought about before workshop. Here, now prosperity is something which is over and above our requirements. This is always craving and increasing the physical facilities, which we really nead at a limited level. And prosperity is nithing but a feeling.;As a human being, my thoughts on myself were self centered, selfish and limited to myself. I thought that human beings living around has tha same thoughts and feelings as I have. Before I held responsible to myself, I will held responsible to others for the deeds, which had negative conotations. ;After the workshop, I learned that before I blame the other people, first of all I should have right feeling and understanding about my feelings and should not be in the control of my emotions. Self retrospection or awareness about self is important factor to develop understanding and harmony among the relationship and society.;Family is life for me. How could one separates himself/herself from the family. In family I am having minor issues which may lead to create temporary arguments with each other. It could be anything minor like my wife not offering tea on time I was expecting. Though I could see her busy in doing some task. My emotions overtakes me and because of is I used to shout at her. Later, i could say sorry when I realised that I did mistake. This could happen repeatedly now and then. ;In the workshop I come across the notion of trust and harmony among the relationship. I also come to know that family relations are not competent to each other but complementary. It the feeling and understanding from myself to other self. So, after realising the right understandig and feeling, I am trying to control the emotional outburst and try to think about the intentions of the family members. I know that their intentions are to make me happy not sad. It is a shift from negative to positive thinking.;Society is the integral part of any human being living on the earth. Society creates our personality, thinking and as a human being our concious efforts are to improve society. Scociety is made of human beings. We have same thought process, choices and understanding. Though person to person it may change but the difference should not be to big. Some of the traditions, unwritten rules whic exist in society are for the betterment for the mankind.;In the workshop I learned that though society is the combination of the human beings who have a common goal to achieve. So that means, at large, society has same beliefs which are neccessary for human beings to exist and servive into the world. To do it effectively, there should be right understanding and feelings among the human beings, should have prosperity (not physical accumalation of the things), fearlessness in the society, and co-existance in nature.;Our existence is in nature and nature is our existence. We owe everything to nature. Nature whole heartedly offers everything to mankind. But as humans we just looted everything from the natute and the process has become too vast that, day by day our hunger is increasing and thats why we are deplecting nature. ;When we think of nature or existance, it also exists in harmony. We are responsible to nurture, protect and right utilization of the nature. We are giving utmost importance to the physical facility and this is the major reason deplection of nature. ;11;"1. It is the need of an our to make aware the coming generation about universal human values.
2. Though we can see the developement in technology, but somewhere we are also aware that family ties have been affected.
3. Everyone is getting busy to achieve physical facility and ignoring the presenst scenario, where we are impacting all the natural resources.

Self-respect comes first because when people don�t respect themselves they don�t know how to respect anything around them,whether it is other people, nature or any other form of life or relationship. ;We usually show our gratitude to others when we feel indebted to them, when we have benefitted from their actions, and when we want to make our feelings towards them known.; It changed my entire way of thinking.

2. Harmony in self leads to Harmony in Family, Harmony in Society and Harmony in Nature
3. The fulfillment and evaluation of the Nine Core Feelings in Relationship leads to mutual happiness. Among these, Trust is the Foundation value which needs to be developed because if Trust is developed, it gives us the clarity that others want to make me happy. This in turn develops the other feelings like Respect, Affection, Care, Guidance, Reverence, Glory, Gratitude and Love. It has to be understood that Love is the complete value which leads to the Feeling of being related to All and this is the foundation for an Undivided Society
4. Human goal is to have Right understanding (in self) and right feeling (for other self) will leads to Right Relationships and prosperity in every family and thereby fearlessness (trust) in the society and ultimately result in co-existence (mutual fulfillment) with Nature.
5. One of the goal of Human order is to be able to thrive for mutual enrichment of other orders like physical order, plant order and animal order
6. Education - Sanskar is the Process of Development of the Competence to live with Definite Human Conduct and Self Discipline.

curiosity.
The very word �competitiveness,� lately a favorite of educators, economists, and politicians, suggests a fundamental confusion between excellence, on the one hand, and the desperate quest to beat people, on the other.
";"When success is defined only by the end results, it doesn't honor the process and how not all aspects of our ""success"" are within our control.
Competition can bring about extraordinary results since it forces us to do our best. Whether competing against someone else or simply looking to beat your last record, the added pressure of competition can create diamonds.";Trust is an arrangement whereby a person believe in the reliability, truth, or ability of other.;To be assured that each human being inherently wants oneself and the other to be happy and prosperous.;Position brings respect and thus makes people happy. Position yields power which provides an opportunity to rule over others. It makes others to respect the one in power. That respect ultimately leads to happiness.;After workshop, it is realized that respect is one of the most important values for human beings and is essential in all its forms. Self-respect comes first because when people don�t respect themselves they don�t know how to respect anything around them,whether it is other people, nature or any other form of life or relationship.;We usually show our gratitude to others when we feel indebted to them, when we have benefitted from their actions, and when we want to make our feelings towards them known.;It changed my entire way of thinking. I believe that I will have more peace in my life as I approach it from a place of gratitude.;We all want to live with happiness and prosperity and at that time whatever we are doing that would not lead us to happiness and prosperity. We are engaged in rat race more and more and more whether it is carrier or collection of physical facilities or leaving behind others.;Now we know that prosperity is nothing to do with accumulating physical facilities. Rather it's a feeling of having and ensuring more than required ( difference between being rich and being prosperous).;I thought that being a human one must educated, rich, prosperous and have all physical facility continuously.;Be the reason someone smiles. Be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people.;A group of people interconnected through different relationships typically consists of parents and children.  ;A fundamental social group emotionally connected to each other by means of love affection respect and trust.;The aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community.;Society is an integrated and organized group of persons associated together for religious, benevolent, cultural, scientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes.;Nature is essential to our lives � from the food on our plates to the clothes we wear, from medicines to mental health benefits.;"Nature-deficit disorder is not the presence of an anomaly in the brain; it is the loss of connection of humans to their natural environment.

and the healthy society. ";Before attending UHV workshops, I thought that becoming a successful teacher should be the only goal of life. ;Now I have understood that the only goal of life is continuous happiness and happiness is not an achievement but an internal feeling to live in harmony with required physical facilities.;"Excellence is in short supply in our nation�s schools � not only because so many children are graduated without basic skills but, more important, because they are not encouraged to think critically or to exercise their natural intellectual curiosity.
The very word �competitiveness,� lately a favorite of educators, economists, and politicians, suggests a fundamental confusion between excellence, on the one hand, and the desperate quest to beat people, on the other.";"When success is defined only by the end results, it doesn't honor the process and how not all aspects of our ""success"" are within our control.
Competition can bring about extraordinary results since it forces us to do our best. Whether competing against someone else or simply looking to beat your last record, the added pressure of competition can create diamonds.";Trust an arrangement whereby a person believe in the reliability, truth, or ability of other. ;Trust to be assured that each human being inherently wants oneself and the other to be happy and prosperous. ;Position brings respect and thus makes people happy. Position wields power which provides an opportunity to rule over others. It makes others to respect the one in power. That respect ultimately leads to happiness.;After workshop, it is realized that Respect is one of the most important values for human beings and is essential in all its forms. Self-respect comes first because when people don�t respect themselves they don�t know how to respect anything around them,whether it is other people, nature or any other form of life or relationship.;We usually show our gratitude to others when we feel indebted to them, when we have benefitted from their actions, and when we want to make our feelings towards them known.;It changed my entire way of thinking. I believe that I will have more peace in my life as I approach it from a place of gratitude.;We all want to live with happiness and prosperity and at that time whatever we are doing that would not lead us to happiness and prosperity. We are engaged in rat race more and more and more whether it is carrier or collection of physical facilities or leaving behind others. ;Now we know that prosperity is nothing to do with accumulating physical facilities. Rather it's a feeling of having and ensuring more than required ( difference between being rich and being prosperous).;I thought that being a human one must educated, rich, prosperous and have all physical facility continuously.;Be the reason someone smiles. Be the reason someone feels loved and believes in the goodness in people.;A group of people interconnected through different relationships typically consists of parents and children.;A fundamental social group emotionally connected to each other by means of love affection respect and trust.;The aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community.;Society is an integrated and organized group of persons associated together for religious, benevolent, cultural, scientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes.;Nature is essential to our lives � from the food on our plates to the clothes we wear, from medicines to mental health benefits.;"Nature-deficit disorder is not the presence of an anomaly in the brain; it is the loss of connection of humans to their natural environment.

For the last fifteen years, i used to be on antidepressent. i attended a number of spiritual workshop.Those were very theoretical.;To be happy, one needs to have the right understanding;I used to be in a dilemma about the purposes of education .  Should young people become educated to get prepared to enter the workforce, or should the purpose of education be focused more on social, academic, cultural and intellectual development so that students can grow up to be engaged citizen;I got the answer, it should be value based education. The basic guidelines for value based education will be: a) universal,b) rational, c) natural and verifiable, d) all encompassing, e) leading to harmony;There are people for whom competition is a fight and academic excellence is a part of the larger struggle for existence. A lot depends on how you view the totality of education and its manifold aspects and your approach to the various issues. One really needs to understand the impact of both competition as well as the level of excellence one may achieve in any task.;Competition, as I understand, becomes a winning proposition if excellence is pursued. Competing for the sake of competition is full of chasms and ends up being a chore that gives no surety of success, whereas if the route to competing is through the pursuit of excellence, it suddenly becomes full of possibilities!; if you trust everybody, people will take undue advantage of you.; Trust: Trust or vishwas is the foundational value in relationship. �To be assured that each human being inherently wants oneself and the other to be happy and prosperous.� If we have trust in the other, we are able to see the other as a relative and not as an adversary.;respect has to be earned, that was my perception;Respect means individuality. The sense of individuality is prime object. This is the first basic step towards respect (sammana). Once we realized that we are individual then only we can see our self different from others. In other words, respect means right evaluation, to be evaluated as I am.;When somebody is doing me a favor, i must show him or her some gratitude.;Gratitude is the feeling of acceptance for those who have made efforts for my excellence. Gratitude is an emotion that occurs after people receive help, depending on how they interpret the situation.;Iwealth;" prosperity is the �feeling of having or making available more than required physical facilities�.In the current scenario, we are generally trying to achieve happiness and prosperity by maximizing accumulation and consumption of physical facilities. This is an attempt to achieve happiness through pleasant sensory interactions. The physical facilities are not seen in terms of fulfilling bodily needs but as a means of maximizing happiness.

This has resulted in wrong assessment of wants for physical facilities as being unlimited. But this pursuit is self-defeating. Neither can we hope to achieve continuous happiness through sensory interactions nor can we have prosperity, as it amounts to trying to fulfil unlimited wants through limited resources. This effort is engendering problems at all the levels. It is becoming anti-ecological and anti-people, and threatening the human survival itself.";no clear idea;"There is the familiar shape and structure of a human being that is immediately apparent to us and we imagine someone with similar human body-like features. But in addition to the body, there is also the aliveness of the person � the entity that keeps the body �alive� and makes it operate in various ways.

We perceive this aliveness in the activities demonstrated by the person like their seeing, talking, listening, walking, and eating, etc. This aliveness is called Jivana. Thus, a human being is coexistence of the body and jivan. This jivan refers to itself as �I� (self). Thus we say �I am so and so� or �I feel tired� or �I am happy� and not �my body is happy�. This I or self is also called �consciousness� and is the sentient constitute of the human being.

The human being is the sum total of sentiments and physical aspect, the self (�I�) and the body, and there is exchange of information between the two, i.e. �I� and body exist together and are related. There is a flow of information from �I� to the body and from body to the �I�";For me family is so much more than just the people I am related to, my family also consists of a supportive and caring group of friends who I can laugh and cry with. Without the strength of community, I feel that I would not have as much hope to be the parent and person that I strive to;Family for me represents the foundation of self, and a unity of acceptance, unconditional sacrifices, joy, support and love that is built on a continuum of resilience, and journey in humility from the past, current and future generations;he aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community.;A society is the largest number of human beings who interact to satisfy their social needs and who share a common culture. �A society may be defined as a network of interconnected major groups viewed as a unit and sharing a common culture� ;e phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations.;"ll the physical objects that are in solid, liquid or gas state either living or non-living, collectively termed as nature. In other words, the aggregate of all the mutually interacting units � big or small, sentient or insentient together can be called nature. These units are infinite in number and we could easily observe that there exists a dynamic balance, self regulation among all these units. There are four orders of nature:

Material order: The big land mass of the continents, gigantic water bodies like ocean and seas, mountains and rivers, the atmosphere above, the heaps of metals and mineral below, the dense gases and fossil fuels deep below the surface of the earth � all fall into the material order or padartha avastha. In fact, if we look around beyond the earth, the material order is visible even in the form of stars, planets, moons and several astronomical bodies.

Pranic order: Our land mass is covered with grass and small shrubs and they form the lining on the entire soil. Shrubs, plants and trees form huge forest along with the flora in the ocean. All of this is the plant/bio order or prana avastha and it is the next big order on our planet. (The material order is far greater in quantity compared to the plant/bio order)

Animal order: Animals and birds form the third largest order and we call them the animal order or jiva avastha. Here again, we see that the plant/bio order is far greater in quantity than the animal order.

Human order: Human are the smallest order and they are referred to as human order or gyana avastha. Animals are far greater in quantity as compared to the human order.";8;to spread the idea of right understanding;Yes;Yes;Yes;4;5;5;5;5;3;5;5;1;1;1;5;1;3;5;1;1;4;3;5;3;5;I volunteered to come for this workshop;4;4;5;4;5;Yes;No suggestion;9830417143;;9830417143;;Techno Main Salt Lake;Kolkata;West Bengal;MAKAUT;Prof(Dr.) Avijit Kar;;principal.tisaltlake@gmail.com;;;Associate Professor;Physics

In this way, the unfolding of the co-existence will be completed through human being.;I thought more due to lack of fulfilment in relationship i was not happy.;physical facility, relationship and right understanding are three distinct realities. All three are required for fulfilment of human being. One cannot be substituted for the other. Right understanding is the first priority, fulfilment in relationship with human being is the second priority and ensuring physical facility is next.;Purpose of Education is to impart knowledge which helps develop human conscience along with studies.;The three things  required: right understanding, relationship and physical facility, and one cannot be substituted for the other. Fulfillment of these three are possible by human consciousness, and for transformation from animal consciousness to human consciousness Education plays a very important role.;Excellence can be achieved by continuously striving for it and healthy competition can help in this.;Excellence is to be in a state of continuous happiness with the completeness of understanding of harmony and living in harmony at all levels. Once we achieve excellence, it continues. Excellence is something definite, something absolute. If you have achieved excellence, you would naturally make effort for helping others to achieve excellence. On the other hand, in competition, we not only do not help rather we hinder the other to reach to our level.;Trust is very important in every relationship.;I am a good person as my intentions are good. On the other hand, when you evaluate the other, you evaluate him on the basis of his/her competence. With the feeling of trust, one is able to see it clearly that the intention is same for all, to be happy and make other happy. The only difference lies in the level of competence;I crave for respect personally, so I make sure to extend respect to all who does not differentiate.;Respect is right valuation. We are similar at the level of purpose, programme and potential and we are complementary at the level of competence. Others are complementary to me. With the complete understanding of respect, we can see for every individual on the earth that we all are the same in terms of intention, program and potential.;I always had a feeling of gratitude towards people who have a role to play in my excellence, my process to understand things.;Gratitude is a significant feeling in the development of relationship.;We prosper when we prosper as an individual. We care and respect others along with physical facility.;The prosperity is a feeling of the availability of more than required physical facility. To ensure it, Right understanding is required at the base, along with physical facility;I took things very casually, was hurt by small things, was getting angry over small issues.;The role of human being is to realize co-existence in the Self and live in co-existence in nature/existence, extending up to universal human order. We need to understand and live in harmony.;I was in harmony with my family.;We should value family and should be in harmony with them. There should be right understanding with physical facility. Every human being has a role in one or more of the social systems, starting from the family order, then the family cluster order and so on to the nation family order and ultimately, the world family order, leading to universal human order;I seem to have little responsibilty for the society.;I need to explore harmony in society.;I care for Nature.;I would surely pay more attention for co existence with nature else there will be resource depletion.

2)I have started to believe in the importance of Harmony in individual(human being),Harmony in family,harmony in society,Harmony in nature/existence.I have started to practise it in my routine life and started to feel how Animal Consciousness is transformed into Human consciousness within myself and started to feel happy.
3)Workshop taught me how to achieve prosperity so easily by setting a feasible requirement limit.
4)Before the workshop I was thinking that human being is a body. Now i knew that human being is the coexistence of self and body.
5) I learnt how continuous happiness and prosperity can be ensured by a combination of Right Understanding,Relationship and Physical facility.
6)I learnt the true meaning of Self Exploration and Nine Feelings in Relationship.
7)I realized existence as co-existence at all levels where units are submerged in space.  ";I thought happiness is all about Physical facility.;Now I knew that continuous happiness can be ensured through a combination of Right Understanding,Relationship and Physical facility.;My idea about Purpose of Education was skill biased.;Now my idea about Purpose of Education is to develop right understanding of the harmony at all levels of being � from self to the entire existence (individual, family, society, and nature/existence).;I thought both are same and excellence is achieved through competition.;Now I knew that excellence is the completeness of right understanding.In excellence one helps to bring the other to his level.But in competition he hinders the other from reaching to his level.;Before the workshop I thought strangers can not be trusted.Trust is developed over a long time.;Now i knew that Trust is something that is to be assured that the other has a natural acceptance (intention) to make me happy and prosperous. Trust on intention is the foundation of relationship. It is the beginning of mutual development.;Before workshop I thought Respect is a gesture.;Respect is the right evaluation on basis of self where our purpose, programme and potential are same.;Gratitude is the feeling of acceptance for those who offer money or kinds.;Gratitude is the feeling of acceptance for those who have made the effort for my excellence.;Prosperity is the accumulation of physical facility as much as possible.;Prosperity is the feeling of having more than required physical facility.;Human being is a BODY whose need is Physical Facilty.;Human being is the co-existence of Self and Body.The need of the Self is happiness (e.g. feeling of respect leading to happiness) while the need of the Body is physical facility (e.g. food). All the needs related to the Self are continuous in time while all the needs related to the Body are required for a limited time.;Family is a number of Relations staying together.;Every human being is born in a family and is part of a family. The family is the basic unit or building block of human organization. It provides a base for appreciating, accepting, understanding and practicing to live in relationship and harmony (order).The harmony in the family has primarily to do with the fulfilment of relationship between one human being and the other human being.Fulfilment of nine feelings in relationship and their evaluation leads to mutual happiness.;Society is a group of independent families staying at a particular place.;Third level of living for a human being is Society. We can see very much that we can conceive of a Society only if it has families living together in a relationship of mutual fulfillment otherwise it is just like a crowd or battlefield.The base of harmony in society is harmony in family for which the base is harmony in human being.;Nature is just a collection of air, soil, water, plants, trees, animals, birds, other human beings and even things that are at a distance from us like the sun, the moon, the other planets, etc.;Nature is the collection of all the units � the air, soil, water, plants, trees, animals, birds, other human beings and even things that are at a distance from us like the sun, the moon, the other planets, etc.It can be classified into four orders, (physical, bio, animal and human). There is a relationship of mutual fulfillment among these. It is already going on in the first three orders. Human being also has the natural acceptance for mutual fulfillment. All that we need to do is to understand it and live accordingly.;15;1)I want to see quality of my students getting enhanced.2)I want to see harmony in the  society which will be possible through my students.3)As a SIP mentor I hope to inculcate Universal Human Values in the students.;Yes;Yes;Yes;5;5;5;5;5;2;5;5;1;5;5;4;1;2;1;1;2;1;3;4;2;5;I was nominated by my institute;5;5;5;3;5;Yes;There is hardly any loophole I could find with such a wonderful Workshop where all the resource persons are so much gifted.But always there is some scope for improvement in every system.One such scope is that the workshop materials may be more detailed.;9437439176;;9437439176;;Faculty of Engineering and Technology(Institute of Technical Education  and Research);Bhubaneswar;Odisha;Siksha 'O' Anusandhan Deemed to be University;Dr Pardeep Kumar Sahoo;;dean.iter@soa.ac.in;9437183060;ITER;Professor;Department of Civil Engineering

I am the person who take care of everything of daily life from cooking, washing, dusting. Sometime I felt unhappy, demotivated that there is no one who can ask a glass of water to me.  ;Now I will not think on that way. I will make understand to my son that family is a team work. We should care to each other.;I always love my family members. I try to understand them.;Now my believe is more stronger after attaining this workshop. ;In society, it is not possible to change others. With this perception I never try to do anything. I donated blood several time, I organised cultural program also. But never try to change the conception of others towards values.;Now I will share whatever I learned from this workshop.;I love nature. I do gardening also. But not think as it is taught in this workshop. ;In this covid situation we understand the value of nature. And after this workshop I realised my responsibility towards my nature.  ;14;1.

I am more happy now from within my Self.;Nowadays purpose of education has become to learn some skills with which we one can make lots of money. For example, learn computer science, and get a job in an IT company, and get handfull of salary. The present education is making the young people job-seekers, and unemployed. ;Even otherwise I had realized the need for value education in our schools and colleges. I am happy to note that AICTE has initiated this process in engineering colleges. I wish the same is taken up in other streams of education too.;Before the w/s, I though that excellence means doing extremely good work in any field which no one else, or very few could achieve. Competition means by hook or crook try to win over the others. ;After the w/s, I am clear in the understanding of the word excellence. It means being in the state of continuous happiness with complete understanding of the harmony at all levels.

Human consciousness is living with continuous happiness and prosperity by ensuring right understanding, fulfilment in relationship and physical facility in the correct priority. Holistic development is the transformation from animal consciousness to human consciousness. Education- sanskar has the most significant role to play in this transformation.
2. Happiness is to be in a state of harmony. The expanse of our living is at four levels (individual human being, family, society and nature/existence), and thus the program for continuity of happiness is to be in harmony at all these levels. Prosperity is the feeling of having more than required physical facility.
3. When the Self has a feeling of self-regulation (the responsibility for nurturing, protection and right utilisation of the Body), and it is able to fulfil this responsibility, the Body is in harmony (good health). This feeling of self-regulation is instrumental in identifying the need for physical facility and ensuring prosperity.
4. Trust is to be assured that the other has a natural acceptance (intention) to make me happy and prosperous. Trust on intention is the foundation of relationship. It is the beginning of mutual development. A common mistake is to evaluate oneself on the basis of one�s intention (and conclude that I am good) and the other on the basis of their lack of competence (thus doubt their intention and conclude that the other is bad).
5. Respect is right evaluation at the level of the Self. The complete content of respect is to see that the other is similar to me in terms of purpose, programme and potential; and we are complementary to each other in terms of competence.
Over evaluation, under/otherwise evaluation and discrimination are disrespect.
6. At the level of society, the human goal is right understanding and right feeling (happiness) in every individual, prosperity in every family, fearlessness (trust) in society and co-existence (mutual fulfilment) in nature/existence. This goal is fulfilled by human order, i.e. systems for education-sanskar, health-self regulation, production-work, justice-preservation and exchange-storage. These systems start
with the family order, and are interconnected right up to world family order, leading to universal human order. The natural process of development of a child in an environment of relationship needs to be understood and fulfilled so that the child grows into a human being who can have the competence to participate in the universal human order.
7. Existence is co-existence, and the role of human being is to realise co-existence in the Self and live in co-existence in nature/existence, extending up to universal human order. In this way, the unfolding of the co-existence will be completed through human being � resulting into universal order.";in a state of contradiction;Discover our natural acceptance;Skill Development;"The value or role of a human being is its participation in the larger order. E.g. my role in living with the other human being is to ensure the feeling of respect in the relationship. Interestingly, I feel happy in fulfilling my role; and it is fulfilling for the other as well!";Lack of right understanding;"Excellence is to be in a state of continuous happiness with the completeness of understanding of harmony and living in harmony at all levels. Once we achieve excellence, it continues. Excellence is something definite, something absolute.
There is a basic difference between working for excellence and competition. If you have achieved excellence, you would naturally make effort for helping others to achieve excellence. On the other hand, in competition, we not only do not help rather we hinder the other to reach to our level.";To make myself always happy;To be assured that the other intends to make me happy and prosperous;Over evaluation;Right evaluation.;Lack of natural acceptance;Gratitude is the feeling of acceptance for those who have made the effort for my excellence. In our life, there may be so many people who have been of help to us in the process of understanding harmony and living in harmony. So, we have this feeling of gratitude for them. Gratitude is a significant feeling in the development of relationship.;Only physical facility;The feeling of having more than required physical facility.;Self;"Human being is co-existence of the Self (Consciousness) and the Body (Material). This can be seen on the basis of exploring into the need, fulfilment of need, activity and response of the Self and the Body.
In particular, the response of the body is definite while the response of the self depends on assuming. With assuming based on knowing, the conduct of a human being gets indefinite.";The problem today is that we assume ourselves to be the Body and we assume the relationship on the basis of the Body (and not the feelings). We, therefore, fail to understand relationship and consequently, we fail to fulfil it, despite all our good intentions. The problems are due to absence of one or more of the right feelings in the Self. And we try to make up this gap by physical facility or by trying to demand these feelings from others, rather than ensuring these feelings in ourselves and sharing it with others.;Every human being is born in a family and is part of a family. The family is the basic unit or building block of human organisation. It provides a base for appreciating, accepting, understanding and practicing to live in relationship and harmony (order).;family order to world family order;"At the level of society, the human goal is right understanding and right feeling (happiness) in every individual, prosperity in every family, fearlessness (trust) in society and co-existence (mutual fulfilment) in nature/existence. This goal is fulfilled by human order, i.e. systems for education-sanskar, health-self regulation, production-work, justice-preservation and exchange-storage. These systems start
with the family order, and are interconnected right up to world family order, leading to universal human order. The natural process of development of a child in an environment of relationship needs to be understood and fulfilled so that the child grows into a human being who can have the competence to participate in the universal human order.";Human order is a part of nature;"Nature is the collection of units. It can be classified into four orders, (physical, bio, animal and human).
There is a relationship of mutual fulfilment amongst these. It is already going on in the first three orders.
Human being also has the natural acceptance for mutual fulfilment. All that we need to do is to understand it and live accordingly.";16;"One can investigate within oneself to see that values that are naturally acceptable and verifiable in living. This can form the basis of living with fulfillment, which is value-based living. Since our current living is not leading to sustained human happiness and prosperity, we need to urgently and clearly find out what is of value, or what is valuable to all human beings and develop our living accordingly.
     The subject that deals with what is of value, or what is valuable to a human being is called value education. Values thus provide the basis for all our actions and activities. Education needs to focus on value-education, which has to be introduced in our school education as well as higher education. Such value-based education can prepare students to live in harmony with other human beings and nature � this can provide a way out of the current morass that the world is in.";Yes;Yes;Yes;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;3;5;3;5;1;5;1;1;3;5;5;1;5;1;I was nominated by my institute;5;5;5;5;5;Yes;Excellent;9944518387;;;;Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College;Coimbatore;Tamil Nadu;Anna University;Dr.N.R.Alamelu;;principal@srec.ac.in;;;Assistance Professor;Physics

Also, our harmonious relationship with people makes them more happy than providing physical facilities.";I was under the belief that upskilling is the only purpose of education and that provides empowerment to students and makes them successful in their lives.;The purpose of education is holistic development of an individual. A student with good value systems would be happier in life than a student who is highly skilled and well placed. Our nation needs future citizens who have right understanding of self and surroundings rather than educated, skilled individuals with no commitment to either self or to surroundings.;I believed that to be successful, we need to be the best among peers. So, the focus was always to compete with the best and be ahead in every sphere.;This workshop has shown that true happiness is when we are able to exceed our limits and help others to achieve their goals.

Now I deal with others with more maturity, understanding and acceptance. ;I felt responsible for my family's happiness and strived hard to keep everyone happy. Sometimes, I felt betrayed when family members did anything wrong, I thought they did it on purpose, or they don't bother that I would be unhappy with their actions;"I feel I am responsible for my happiness, I must first be happy to make others happy.
Also, Ideal with family members with more patience now and believe it is lack of competency that makes them do something wrong and they have the right intensions. This belief  comforts me.";A non entity, I thought if I am happy and my family is satisfied, I don't need to bother about the society.;Now I think we owe the society. We need to truly have right understanding and help others to have right and justified life.;I always believed in the power of nature.

Holistic development is the transformation from animal consciousness to human consciousness. Education- sanskar has the most significant role to play in this transformation.;Happiness is to be in a state of harmony. The expanse of our living is at four levels (individual human being, family, society and nature/existence), and thus the program for continuity of happiness is to be in harmony at all these levels. Prosperity is the feeling of having more than required physical facility;When the Self has a feeling of self-regulation (the responsibility for nurturing, protection and right utilisation of the Body), and it is able to fulfil this responsibility, the Body is in harmony (good health). This feeling of self-regulation is instrumental in identifying the need for physical facility and ensuring prosperity;. skill development;"The value or role of a human being is its participation in the larger order. E.g. my role in living with the other human being is to ensure the feeling of respect in the relationship. Interestingly, I feel happy in fulfilling my role; and it is fulfilling for the other as well";Lack of right understanding;"Excellence is to be in a state of continuous happiness with the completeness of understanding of harmony and living in harmony at all levels. Once we achieve excellence, it continues. Excellence is something definite, something absolute.
There is a basic difference between working for excellence and competition. If you have achieved excellence, you would naturally make effort for helping others to achieve excellence. On the other hand, in competition, we not only do not help rather we hinder the other to reach to our level.";To make myself always happy;To be assured that the other intends to make me happy and prosperous;over evaluation;right evaluation;Lack of natural acceptance;Gratitude is the feeling of acceptance for those who have made the effort for my excellence. In our life, there may be so many people who have been of help to us in the process of understanding harmony and living in harmony. So, we have this feeling of gratitude for them. Gratitude is a significant feeling in the development of relationship;"Only physical facility
";The feeling of having more than required physical facility;self;"Human being is co-existence of the Self (Consciousness) and the Body (Material). This can be seen on the basis of exploring into the need, fulfilment of need, activity and response of the Self and the Body.
In particular, the response of the body is definite while the response of the self depends on assuming. With assuming based on knowing, the conduct of a human being gets indefinite.";The problem today is that we assume ourselves to be the Body and we assume the relationship on the basis of the Body (and not the feelings). We, therefore, fail to understand relationship and consequently, we fail to fulfil it, despite all our good intentions. The problems are due to absence of one or more of the right feelings in the Self. And we try to make up this gap by physical facility or by trying to demand these feelings from others, rather than ensuring these feelings in ourselves and sharing it with others;Every human being is born in a family and is part of a family. The family is the basic unit or building block of human organisation. It provides a base for appreciating, accepting, understanding and practicing to live in relationship and harmony (order);family order to world family order;"At the level of society, the human goal is right understanding and right feeling (happiness) in every individual, prosperity in every family, fearlessness (trust) in society and co-existence (mutual fulfilment) in nature/existence. This goal is fulfilled by human order, i.e. systems for education-sanskar, health-self regulation, production-work, justice-preservation and exchange-storage. These systems start
with the family order, and are interconnected right up to world family order, leading to universal human order. The natural process of development of a child in an environment of relationship needs to be understood and fulfilled so that the child grows into a human being who can have the competence to participate in the universal human order.
";Human order is a part of nature;"Nature is the collection of units. It can be classified into four orders, (physical, bio, animal and human).
There is a relationship of mutual fulfilment amongst these. It is already going on in the first three orders.
Human being also has the natural acceptance for mutual fulfilment. All that we need to do is to understand it and live accordingly.";16;"One can investigate within oneself to see that values that are naturally acceptable and verifiable in living. This can form the basis of living with fulfillment, which is value-based living. Since our current living is not leading to sustained human happiness and prosperity, we need to urgently and clearly find out what is of value, or what is valuable to all human beings and develop our living accordingly.
     The subject that deals with what is of value, or what is valuable to a human being is called value education. Values thus provide the basis for all our actions and activities. Education needs to focus on value-education, which has to be introduced in our school education as well as higher education. Such value-based education can prepare students to live in harmony with other human beings and nature � this can provide a way out of the current morass that the world is in";Yes;Yes;Yes;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;5;2;2;1;3;1;5;5;1;1;2;2;4;1;5;I volunteered to come for this workshop;5;5;5;5;5;Yes;Human values  can be for throught out the year  as a Part of a  content in each subject not only as SIP at the begining.Human values is a continuous process .hence to be included;9842523874;;9842523874;;Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College;Coimbatore;Tamil Nadu;Anna University;Dr.N.R.Alamelu;;principal@srec.ac.in;04222461588;SREC;Associate Professor;Physics

2) It is important for us to see the other self as our own self.
3) It's not right for humans to have animal consciousness. Humans should have human consciousness.
4) Right understanding creates mutual happiness.
5) Mutual happiness creates an undivided society.
6) It's important to learn the values along with the skills.
7) Needs of the self and needs of the body are different. Needs of the self are continuous and those of the body are temporary.
8) Humans have to live in harmony with one's own self, other humans, society and Nature.
9) Human values are verifiable at the level of our Natural Acceptance.
10) As humans, we are dependent on all three orders, i.e., physical order, plant order and animal order. ";I was always taught since childhood that contentment is great gain. I knew that I was a happy person. There was satisfaction. But yes, sometimes we have the basis of the satisfaction from what we have. Our physical facilities make us happy and our relationship with the Divine gives us joy and satisfaction. From a religious point of view, I was taught that Humans were three entities, Spirit, Soul/Conscience and Body. Body connects with Nature, Conscience with other humans and Spirit with the Divine/God.;"This workshop, has concentrated more on the physical mode and the Conscience mode. It has explained that, this ""I"" is our consciousness and when this I is in harmony with itself, it's true happiness. This 'Self' should not just be happy, but also consider the happiness of others around us.";"Education, usually in our society is just getting a graduation or a post graduation degree to show off to the society and to get a job, that'll fetch us a decent income to have some standard in the society. Our schools and colleges have taught us or some of our teachers must've mocked some of the students by saying that without good education, you'll become a labourer or sweeper or an auto driver or so on....... 
As time passes by, we feel, I we need to get a good graduation certificate, to get a white collared job, and this mindset remains with us. Teaching other values are mostly left out for parents or grandparents.";It is good to know after this workshop, that as a teacher, I can give value education to my students. Make them understand that education is not just developing skills, but developing values too and thus have a harmonious relationship with everybody around.;"According to me, to excel was to become the topper of some examination that we take or to be first in any work done, to get some praises from others. I understand it's childish, but the society has groomed us like that.
To Excel, it's important to compete with others. To compete, was to run the rat race in all phases of life.";To excel and to compete are different. Even here in competition, we run the race, to prove ourselves better than the others, But Excellence is not just to succeed, but to take others together with us to the finishing line. It's important to help and lift those towards our level.;I can trust myself, I can trust my family and friends, but I cannot trust everyone everywhere, may be at work place, society in which we live in, etc. ;"the question that "" Am I able to trust the other person as I trust myself?"" is difficult to answer. Yes, we still cannot trust everyone everywhere, but I realized not to differentiate someone based on our prejudice or based on what someone else has told about them.";"I was taught that a Self Respecting person always Respects others. So, if we are self respecting, we should first learn to respect others. I was also taught that, ""We should do unto others, what we want them to do for us"". If I do not want to be shouted at, then I should be conscious not to shout at others and be polite. If i do not want to be cheated by someone, then I should be very careful, not to cheat anyone.";"Respect is the right evaluation. Respect is the need of the ""Self"" for all humans, irrespective of their status in the society.";I was taught since childhood that Gratitude is thanksgiving. Giving thanks for all that we have and all that we can give to others. It is a grateful heart for what I was, what I am and what I will be. It is having a grateful heart for all our Blessings as having good parents, good friends, good and healthy body parts, etc.;I've understood that Gratitude is a 'feeling' for those who have made an effort for my excellence.;To be prosperous was to be rich. Rich especially when it comes to finances and owning possessions for ourselves. So, usually, it is not we who are prosperous, but others with a bigger house or a bigger car, etc. ;Prosperity is not making comparisons, but a feeling of having more than required physical facility. In a way, it is to have complete satisfaction with what we have.;Is a physical personality, who is different from other beings walking on the earth. Human being is intellectually powerful and has the earth and it's natural resources under his control.;Human being is not just a physical intellectual personality, but being who is human. Human being is one who has human consciousness.;Family is a God made unit of the society. It is an institution where two humans ( a man and a woman) live in mutual understanding with each other, blessed by elders,  as a part of society. It a place, where children born have safety and security, where both the parents nurture and care for their children.;Family is the second level in Harmony. First we are at harmony with ourselves, then we learn to live at harmony with our family members.;"As learned from childhood that 'man is a social animal', this human needs other social beings to live with him/her is cordial relationship. Hence many humans come together and live in a society for mutual good of one another. A very good example of a good Society that comes to my mind is when there was no currency 
 and humans exchanged their produce/goods with each other for survival (Barter system)  ";Society is a group of families living together for social good and mutual fulfillment, each family not just lives in harmony within itself, but also with other families.;Nature is a biological unit, where all beings, as humans, animals, plants co exist. Humans being intellectually powerful, exploit nature for natural resources and for his comfort and facilities.;Nature is a collection of units with 4 orders, physical order, Bio order, Animal order and Human order. These orders need to be recognizing and fulfilling towards each other. Human order is dependent on the other 3 orders for survival. So, Human order has to live in harmony in other orders and nourish them.;15;"1) As a teacher, teaching human values should be my priority and I feel honoured to do it.
2) System of education has deteriorated. It's important to make our young generation realize that education is not just learning skills to earn, but learning values to lead a happy and prosperous life.
3) It is important for students to realise what it is to live in harmony with themselves first and then with others.

In addition to this we must make efforts to rightly understand one's intention before we make a judgment.  So I can say is that right understanding , feeling, fulfillment of relationship and trusting one's intention are the key to happiness and prosperity of the family.;I thought that happiness is just about doing your job in time and without any problems and having enough of physical facilities. I had very little time for family.;But after the workshop I realize that we must have proper understanding , feeling and correct evaluation of one's intent to sort out problems and misunderstandings between family members leading to happiness. But at the same time I see that having acquired more and more physical facilities , still after some time further more list of physical facilities creeps in to the mind.That doesn't contribute to happiness. In addition , I am spending more time with my family than before.;I thought that education can only enlighten us in terms of our knowledge in the subjects that we read/teach leading to better skills.;Now I think that, right education can not only enlighten us in terms of our knowledge in the subjects that we read/teach leading to better skills but also it imparts the values of life within us. Thus helps in having sanskar.;I thought that excellence can only be achieved by competition only.;After the workshop , I think that only competition  will put me in opposition with others.  Many people may not like this. I may be creating enemies. There will be differences as well. But with right frame of mind if we can try to achieve excellence through right understanding, self-evaluation, hard work and believing in ourselves.;I thought that trust is only believing in someone or something.;But  now I feel that, if the other person has the intention to make me happy and prosperous then he/she can be trusted, even if he/she may not be able to do it due to lack of competence. This is trust for me now.;Earlier I thought that respect is just following the things that is told to us in our childhood to respect elders , senior people, our teachers and friends/relatives.;Now I can feel that I need to evaluate a person rightly and feel the other person is also similar to me in terms of potential, purpose and program. So if I am good , then the other is also good and of similar capability. That is respect for me towards the other. If it is the case of my family , then also I can take help of right evaluation of my family members that is respect for me towards them.;I earlier thought that showing  thankfulness is gratitude.;But now I learnt that having a right feeling of acceptance for those people who have contributed their part for my excellence. Such feeling is gratitude.;Earlier I thought that when I will have this I will be prosperous, when I will have that I will be prosperous. Mostly I was thinking of physical facilities, but that thinking seemed almost endless, because human desires are unlimited.;But now I understand that I cannot put an end to my needs for physical facilities. So once I feel that I have more than required physical facility or I have more than enough then only I can have prosperity.;I mostly thought the human being (Myself) to be synonymous with my body only.;I realized that the human being (Myself) to be the co-existence of my Self and my body . Both components have different type of needs.;Family is an aggregation of members(such as my parents, my spouse, my children, etc.);The family is the basic unit or building block of human organization, wherein with the fulfillment of relationship between one human being and the other human being harmony within the family can be ensured.;Earlier I thought society means a group of families living together.;Now I can realize that only if a group of families living together in a relationship of mutual fulfillment then only it is a society otherwise it is just like a crowd where everyone is unknown to each other and not concerned about each other.;I thought it as the aggregation of water, soil, air, plants, humans, animals, birds as components only.;Now I could think nature to be composed of four orders, physical, bio, animal and human.

life happy and in continuous happiness, helping others which are in need respecting and maintaining relationships are the key to happiness and harmony including self
happiness we are also a part of the society and we are responsible for the betterment and the healthy society.";Before attending HVPE workshops, I thought that becoming a successful teacher should be the only goal of life;Now I have understood that the only goal of life is continuous happiness and happiness is not an achievement but an internal feeling to live in harmony with required physical facilities.;"The very word �competitiveness,� lately a favorite of educators, economists, and politicians, suggests a fundamental confusion between excellence, on the one hand, and the desperate quest to beat people, on the other.
Excellence is in short supply in our nation�s schools � not only because so many children are graduated without basic skills but, more important, because they are not encouraged to think critically or to exercise their natural intellectual curiosity.";"When success is defined only by the end results, it doesn't honor the process and how not all aspects of our ""success"" are within our control.
Competition can bring about extraordinary results since it forces us to do our best. Whether competing against someone else or simply looking to beat your last record, the added pressure of competition can create diamonds.";An arrangement whereby a person believe in the reliability, truth, or ability of other.;To be assumed that each human being inherently wants oneself and the other to be happy and prosperous. ;"Position brings respect and thus makes people happy.
Position wields power which provides an opportunity to rule over others. It makes others to respect the one in power. That respect ultimately leads to happiness.";After workshop, it is realized that Respect is one of the most important values for human beings and is essential in all its forms. Self-respect comes first because when people don�t respect themselves they don�t know how to respect anything around them,whether it is other people, nature or any other form of life or relationship.;"We usually show our gratitude to others when we feel indebted to them, when we have benefitted from their actions, and when we want to make our feelings towards them known.

Showing gratitude is sometimes a required or expected thing, but at other times, a spontaneous �thank you� to someone who has unknowingly made our day. On most occasions, we show gratitude to bring the good feelings we have been gifted back to the gifter.";It changed my entire way of thinking. I believe that I will have more peace in my life as I approach it from a place of gratitude.;We all want to live with happiness and prosperity and at that time whatever we are doing that would not lead us to happiness and prosperity. We are engaged in rat race more and more and more whether it is carrier or collection of physical facilities or leaving behind others;Now we know that prosperity is nothing to do with accumulating physical facilities.

Struggle and competition was the only thing in the world to survive.;"Now I understood that Excellence and competing with each other is not the same thing and are completely different things. In excellence, one helps to bring the other to his level whereas in competition, he hinders the other from reaching to his level. I can recall the concept of ubantu.  It is often translated as ""I am because we are,"" or ""humanity towards others,"" , but it is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean ""the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity. It leads to win win situation for both/all. That can lead to mutual happiness.";My thoughts on trust before the workshop was just unconditional belief or support from the spouse, friends and immediate family members.;My thoughts are completely changed after the workshop. This workshop has completely given different dimension of intention and competence . Now I need to check the competence of individual family members. Then on that basis I will plan out the program as per the individual. For those members who have less competence, we will try to enhance their competence through dialogue and continuous encouragement. I will also try to enhance my capability to make them understand. And for the members whose competence is higher , I may try to make them understand by raising our capabilities or will find a suitable person whose competence is equal to or higher than him.;My thoughts before workshop of respect was admiration of seniors, elders because of their qualities and achievements.;My thoughts on respect is changed completely. Now I know new words Right Evaluation, Over evaluation, Under evaluation and Otherwise evaluation. Only Right evaluation gives you respect and leads to happiness. Over evaluation, Under evaluation and Otherwise evaluation gives disrespect.;"My thoughts on Gratitude before the workshop was the quality of being thankful; readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness.";My thoughts on Gratitude after the workshop is the Feeling for those who have made effort for my excellence.;The state of being prosperous, having a big house, a car, having good food, all physical facilities.;My thoughts now (at the end of the workshop) on Prosperity  is The feeling of having / producing more than required Physical Facility. Feeling contended / prosper now.;My thoughts about myself before the workshop was only Body.

9-26-2020 9:18:30;pooja@symlaw.edu.in;pooja@symlaw.edu.in;(21-25 Sep 2020) AICTE Incorporating Universal Human Values in Education;Dr.;Dr. Pooja Kapoor;3;5;We all heard about the value education is important to help everyone in improving the value system that he/she holds and puts it to use. Once, one has understood his/ her values in life he/she can examine and control the various choices he/she makes in his/ her life. It had enabled me to understand human needs and visualize my goals correctly and also helps to remove my confusions and contradictions and bring harmony at all levels. No doubt this FDP had helped me in inculcating the difference between discrimination and differentiation. We also need to understand the universality of various human values, because only then we can have a definite and common program for value education. Then only we can be assured of a happy and harmonious human society.;Looking into only physical facility;Happiness is universal in nature and all encompassing. ;To earn the livelihood;"Correct identification of our aspirations. It also helps to remove our confusions and contradictions and bring harmony at all levels.
�  Understanding universal human values to fulfil our aspirations in continuity. Once we know what is valuable to us, these values becomes the basis, the anchor for our actions. We also need to understand the universality of various human values, because only then we can have a definite and common program for value education. Then only we can be assured of a happy and harmonious human society.
�  Complimentarity of values and skills. To fulfil our aspirations both values and skills are necessary. 
�  Evaluation of our beliefs. Each one of us believes in certain things and we base our values on these beliefs, be they false or true which may or may not be true in reality. These believes come to us from what we read, see, hear, what our parents tells us, our friends talk about, what the magazines talk of, what we see from TV etc. 
�  Technology and human values. The present education system has become largely skill-based. The prime emphasis is on science and technology. However, science and technology can only help to provide the means to achieve what is considered valuable. ";Have more competition streak, was not able to accept the excellence in others;The excellence or the success of any professional activity is to be judged from this comprehensive point of view only and not in terms of just wealth generation. Accordingly, the profession is not only a means of earning one�s livelihood but a means of one�s evolution by appropriate participation in the larger order. It is an important activity to authenticate one�s understanding, whereby interact with other human beings and with rest of nature in a mutually fulfilling manner. We should strive for the excellence by helping others rather than put them down. ;It is the foundational value of any relationship and should not betray it. Looking only from individual perspective. ;Trust in society means every member of society feels related to everyone else and therefore there is trust and fearlessness.  It remains invariant with time. For example our natural acceptance for trust and respect does not change with age.;We should respect our elders and respect the decisions of others.;"Respect means accepting individuality and doing right evaluation (to be evaluated as I am). Instead of respect being a basis of similarity or one of right evaluation, we have made it into something on the basis of which we differentiate i.e. by respecting you mean you are doing something special, because you are special or have something special or are in some special position. Thus, all of us are running around seeking respect from one another by trying to become something special. 
Today, we are differentiating in the name of respect. We either differentiate people on the basis of their body, on the basis of their wealth and possessions or on the basis of their beliefs. There is no notion of respect in terms of right evaluation. Thus, there is no real feeling of relationship, only one of differentiation, which was rightfully been explained in FDP.";I use to feel gratitude for the persons who had helped me in the times of my hardships.;Gratitude is an emotion that occurs after people receive help, depending on how they interpret the situation. This workshop had thought me that we should be gratitude to everyone as they had helped us in shaping the human beings as we are today.;Associated with wealth and status;It means self regulation, Production and work are for physical facilities, and this leads to a feeling of prosperity in the family. Production is done in harmony with nature, and hence, this also leads to co-existence with nature. When we store and exchange for mutual fulfilment and not for exploitation, then it leads to fearlessness (trust) in society, which lead to prosperity.;I use to think that I had inculcated lot of human values.;But this FDP was an eye opener, it thought me the values of myslef and society as a whole. ;A small tight unit which is based on love and trust;To have a right understanding among the members of the family.;Where people interact with other people and be a social animal. ;We are human being who have right understanding and are rational creatures. ;It is god gift and is our property.

2. Bio order � this includes grass, plants, trees, etc.
3. Animal order � this includes animals and birds.
4. Human order � this has human being only.
There is a relationship of mutual fulfilment amongst these. It is already going on in the first three orders. Human being also has the natural acceptance for mutual fulfilment. All that we need to do is to understand it and live accordingly.";13;"1. To improvise myself

The harmony in the self, in the human being, in the society and with the nature has to be understood by natural acceptance;My thought of happiness before the workshop  is to earn money, own a house, switch over to better job and save for my children.;At the end of the workshop, I understood happiness is nothing but any human being to be in a state of Harmony. This can be acieved by right understanding and right relationship with self, societ and nature.;My thoughts about education before the workshop was to develop skills, get a better job and also respect human values.;After the workshop, the true education system should not only teach technologies and devlop skills, but the main purpose to teach universal human values, with which only a human can be successful and happiness becomes definite in his life.;Excellence as the word reveals to be the best in anything, whether it is career, family (or) in society.Competition is comparing with other people and excel them in all dimensions (whether it is money,job, awards, car etc).;Excellence means the completeness of right understanding. In excellence, one helps to bring the other to his level, whereas in competition, he hinders the other from reaching to his level.;Trust is just having confidence in one's sayings (or) his actions, thoughts etc.;Trust is the foundational value in relationship.Trust is to have the clarity that the other wants to make me happy & prosperous. Trust gives respect and also paves way for other feelings.;My thoughts about respect before the workshop is that it means to obey elders and parents. Also must  hear their thoughts and act accordingly.;Respect means right evaluation (with a feeling of trust on intention).Respect on the basis of Self reveals that the other is like me and we are complementary to each other. ;Gratitude is to thank the people who has helped me in some means either for my education (or) living (or) lending money etc.;Gratitude is the feeling for those who have made effort for my excellence.;Prospertity is to being in very good position (or) possessing more wealth or having more money.;The feeling of having / producing more than required Physical Facility is referred to as prosperity.;Myself mostly refers to my physical structure and working hard for fulfillment of my physical needs.;My self and the body are co-existence of each other. I have to self explore to do right understanding and right feeling of relationship to bring happiness continuously. Self is consciousness and body is the material. The recognition & fulfillment in the self is on the basis of knowing, assuming.;Family is a group of people living together in a same place.;Family is the basic unit or building block of human organisation.Family is a group of people in which every individual has different feelings in relationship. These feelings can be recognized by right understanding of self and they are definite.Their fulfilment, evaluation leads to mutual happiness.;Society is a larger group of families living together with their own culture, beliefs and thoughts among a group of families. Society is divided community of people.;"Society is composed of many families living together making collective
effort for a common goal. Families living together, in a relationship of mutual fulfillment constitute the society.";Nature is the composition of trees, plants, animals, water resources, air with pro;Nature is a collection of uints of 4 orders namely physical order, bio order, animal order and human order.Dependence of each order is on all previous orders.Physical Order, Bio Order and Animal Order are enriching for Human Order, but Human Order (without right understanding) is not fulfilling for any of the 4 orders.The role of human being is to realize this mutual fulfilment and there is provision in nature for living with mutual fulfilment (harmony).;14;"1.

Right evaluations of oneself and of others and an environment of attaining excellence rather than going into competition leads to a healthy and harmonious society. ;It was my perception that peace of my own mind and as also that of others related to me, a  mutually respecting environment,a good career for myself and my kids and satisfying most of the physical facilities will bring happiness. ;After this workshop, I ve learnt how to bring in harmony in the society through rightful evaluation, by creating an ambience of attainment of excellence and not competition in all spheres can bring in happiness. ;Purpose of education according to me is a holistic development of a child, in all spheres of life. It should inculcate in them not only technical knowledge, but also knowhows of the universe if which he is a part. ;At the end of this workshop, my views have been strengthened more with better understanding of interpersonal relationships and how education has a much wider meaning of spreading the message of attaining excellence together. ;My thoughts before this workshop was that, to excel you should embark on competitions. ;"At the end of this session, I have realised that competition alone will create an environment of differentiation which is not conducive for developing a complementary environment. 
";According to me, trust was believed to be a feeling that can be reserved only for a few people. ;Trust can be universally reserved. ;Earlier, according to me respect could  be shown to people belonging to any category, caste or creed or into any sort of profession, but the concept of being complementary of the other was not there. ;After this workshop, I ve grasped that respect brings about a sense of complementary with the other self. ;Showing gratitude towards someone makes that person happy and content and gives me an opportunity to show how much I am thankful to that person;Now, I have learnt that this also fosters a feeling of a happy relationship with the other. ;Prosperity mainly comes from fulfilling physical facilities. ;Physical facilities in excess can create disharmony leading to unhappiness and not prosperity. ;As a human being I can balance myself between ethics , values and relationships. ;I have gathered more insights to deal with life. ;"There are certain issues which were getting complicated and solution was not clear. 
";"
Now armed with insights of universal intentions, different levels of competence and  right knowledge of trust, gratitude, I am able to resolve differences better. ";. ;. ;We are solely dependent on nature, and it's our duty to return back to nature in plenty, that we are acerpting from it. ;"Nature should not be depleted, as this will create a disbalance in the universe and in our very own existence. 
";14;"I want to spread this message of human values to the next generation who will be would be teachers, entrepreneurs and parents. 
To inculcate the values of tolerance, complementarian, respect   gratitude in my family. 
To build a better society ,leading to a better nation and finally a better world with compassionate humans.

But after workshop my reactions are changed to response;Earlier, contributions and efforts towards family and job were making me stressed and tired and at the end I was getting all waste as nobody was acknowledging those efforts which I was extending for them only in my opinion.; But after the workshop I evaluated and observed that whatever I am contributing is preferably for my own sake, for my family, for my profession and ultimately for my happiness and nothing I am doing for others.;Before this workshop I used to see the problem around me at the level society but now I am able to see my role to ensure solution at all level. ;This subject helped me a lot to understand myself.

Value component is missing in present day mainstream education. If we are able to ensure the value component, the education on skills will be properly placed, we will be able to make right utilization of the skills and there will be full development of human personality (both mindset and skills) and hence national development.
The base of harmony in society is harmony in family for which the base is harmony in human being. Human being is a co-existence of self and body. Self is consciousness and body are material. Basic human aspiration is happiness and prosperity. The needs of self are continuous happiness which can be fulfilled by activities of consciousness like right understanding and right feeling. The needs of body are physio-chemical things. The required physical facility can be identified and quantified. When we feel that we have more physical facility than required, we become prosperous.
The self has activity of desire, thought and expectation, together called imagination. This is going on continuously. Behavior or work is an expression or outcome of imagination. Imagination is motivated by preconditioning, sensation or natural acceptance. Imagination in the self, based on natural acceptance only leads to continuous happiness and prosperity.
There are nine feelings in relationship in one self for the other self. Trust on intention is the foundation of relationship. It is the starting point for mutual development. Once trust, respect, affection, care, guidance, reverence, glory, gratitude is ensured within, then the feeling of being related to all (love) follows naturally. Love is the complete value. Love needs to be understood rightly by all, particularly by youth. The feeling of love is the foundation of undivided society.
Nature is a collection of units like plant, animal, physical order and human order. All these orders except human order are in harmony. The human being must realize this co-existence, mutual fulfillment (harmony), and relationship and live accordingly. Human beings inherently have a natural acceptance to know, to be in harmony. For this, human education-sanskar is essential.

There can be live examples/practical to explain how to evaluate a concept. For example, to know about trust, we say let us explore by asking some simple questions (8 in number). But we can extend it a little further. For a better understanding we can have a retrospective look. Let us think about a person to whom you love most, think about your answers. Now think about a person who loves you most and think about your answers. Similar exercise you do for a person you hate most and a person who hates/does not lie you. In this way you can have a better understanding about the trust and you can now evaluate a relationship on the ground of trust.  I will be happy to be a part of such exercises.

And technical or job oriented courses Mainly concentrates on professional skills. ;I always had in my mind, that, after so much growth in literate people in the world, why still the harming, paining, killing or any such bad characters are increasing day by day in the world. And this session supported me, regarding this limitation, in our current syllabus. If AICTE will help and support to bring such values to inside the young ind then definitely, we can expect a better society in future. ;I had in my mind is skills are the one, which always, needed for an individual.  Which will may expert an individual regarding any subject. Thus he will remain competitive. ;It is not the skills, it is the values which makes the individual, to excel in any field. And rather than becoming competitive, excellence takes a major part to build an personality. SO we should guide our kids or students in such a way.;Very partially I had in my mind that trust is needed in relationships.;Now, I'm very much clear about trust. Trust is a fundamental feeling out of nine feelings, and trust will help to keep a good relationship and trust will assist for any other feeling.;This I had from the before. Like for elders we should respect.;Now I feel for any relationship respect is must. If we could respect others then only a healthy relationship could be maintained.;Gratitude always needed which I had.;And same though continued after workshop too;Usually I never think of prosperity;I understood the interrelationship between right understanding, relationship and physical priority and how it helps to gain prosperity.;Also I preferred to be a human or being human. And certain sessions highlighted me to self explore, within myself where it is lacking.;From, the session itself a first think, highlighted me was, a drastic shift from animal consciousness to human consciousness. ;Family I took it as responsibility;Workshop focused me the importance of love, trust, gratitude, glory, forgiveness, etc, how important in the family.;Mine and workshops explore were similar regarding the society. ;In workshop the exploration was much clear and it highlighted me how society is differentiated. And how we can move further by leaving behind all those differentiation's. ;Nature is a wonderful gift which we need to save, to save or survive  healthy, safely and happily.;My though was explored in the session and they divided it into orders and showed how much human order is depended on nature or other orders.;14;I'm an mentor in SIP, where I had taken up sessions related to values.;Yes;Yes;Yes;5;5;5;5;5;2;5;5;3;5;2;5;1;2;2;2;1;1;3;2;2;5;I was nominated by my institute;5;5;5;5;5;Yes;nil;7760308562;;7760308562;;SAHYADRI COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT;MANGALORE;Karnataka;VTU;Dr. Rajesha S.;;principal.engineering@sahyadri.edu.in;;SCEM;Assistance Professor;MBA
